Preface to the
Sixth Edition
I am pleased to place before the readers a thoroughly revised, enlarged and
updated edition of this widely read book on Indian Polity.
In 2011 and 2013, the UPSC changed the pattern and syllabus of the
preliminary and main examinations, respectively. Both times, the scope of
Indian Polity has been considerably increased. Hence, this new edition of
the book is more relevant now and is aimed to meet the expanded needs of
the aspirants.
In the course of revision and updation of this edition of the book, various
new developments related to the subject, like recent constitutional
amendments, parliamentary legislations, executive decisions and supreme
court judgments, have been taken into account.
Changes in this Edition:
1.  Addition of 6 new chapters.
2.  Inclusion of 2017, 2018 and 2019 preliminary questions with
answers.
3.  Inclusion of 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019 mains questions.
4.  Updation of the year-wise break-up of the UPSC questions in the
preliminary and main examinations.
5.  Inclusion of additional updated information on a number of topics.
6.  New items included in various chapters.
New Chapters:
1.  Goods and Services Tax Council
2.  National Commission for Backward Classes
3.  National Investigation Agency
4.  National Disaster Management Authority
5.  Role of Regional Parties
6.  Coalition Government
I firmly believe that this is now a very comprehensive and updated
manual. It is a matter of immense satisfaction that the previous five editions
of this book have received an overwhelming response from readers. I am
confident that readers would continue to repose their faith in this edition as
well.
Constructive comments and concrete suggestions to further improve the
book are welcome and shall be gratefully acknowledged.

Preface to the
First Edition
I have great pleasure in placing this book before the aspirants of the top
administrative services. The book has been written to meet the growing
requirements of the candidates appearing for the Civil Services
Examinations (Preliminary and Main) conducted by the Union Public
Service Commission. It directly and fully covers the Indian Polity section of
the paper on General Studies and is also useful for certain optional subjects
like Public Administration, Political Science, Law, Sociology and
Anthropology.
This comprehensive volume would enable the readers to acquire a
complete and detailed understanding of the subject. It covers all dimensions
(constitutional, non-constitutional, political and administrative) of the
subject. My first-hand experience of coaching the candidates for the Civil
Services Examinations has been a great source of inspiration and has helped
me immensely in writing this book.
An effort has been made to make the contents of the book relevant,
authentic, and up-to-date. The constitutional provisions are explained in the
light of the debates of the Constituent Assembly of India as well as the
judgements of the Supreme Court and the high courts. I have also used
tables to make the presentation more clear. The Appendices, provided at the
end of the book, serve as a reference section.
I welcome all constructive comments and concrete suggestions from the
readers of this book.

1 Historical Background
The British came to India in 1600 as traders, in the form of East India
Company, which had the exclusive right of trading in India under a charter
granted by Queen Elizabeth I. In 1765, the Company, which till now had
purely trading functions obtained the ‘diwani’ (i.e., rights over revenue and
civil justice) of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa.1 This started its career as a
territorial power. In 1858, in the wake of the ‘sepoy mutiny’, the British
Crown assumed direct responsibility for the governance of India. This rule
continued until India was granted independence on August 15, 1947.
With Independence came the need for a Constitution. Hence, a
Constituent Assembly was formed for this purpose in 1946 and on January
26, 1950, the Constitution came into being. However, various features of
the Indian Constitution and polity have their roots in the British rule. There
were certain events in the British rule that laid down the legal framework
for the organisation and functioning of government and administration in
British India. These events have greatly influenced our constitution and
polity. They are explained here in a chronological order under two major
headings :
1.  The Company Rule (1773 – 1858)
2.  The Crown Rule (1858 – 1947)
THE COMPANY RULE (1773–1858)
Regulating Act of 1773
This act was of great constitutional importance as (a) it was the first step
taken by the British Government to control and regulate the affairs of the
East India Company in India; (b) it recognised, for the first time, the
political and administrative functions of the Company; and (c) it laid the
foundations of central administration in India.
The features of this Act were as follows:
1.  It designated the Governor of Bengal as the ‘Governor-General of
Bengal’ and created an Executive Council of four members to assist
him. The first such GovernorGeneral was Lord Warren Hastings.
2.  It made the governors of Bombay and Madras presidencies
subordinate to the governor-general of Bengal, unlike earlier, when the
three presidencies were independent of one another.
3.  It provided for the establishment of a Supreme Court at Calcutta
(1774) comprising one chief justice and three other judges.
4.  It prohibited the servants of the Company from engaging in any
private trade or accepting presents or bribes from the ‘natives’.
5.  It strengthened the control of the British Government over the
Company by requiring the Court of Directors (governing body of the
Company) to report on its revenue, civil, and military affairs in India.
Amending Act of 1781
In a bid to rectify the defects of the Regulating Act of 1773, the British
Parliament passed the Amending Act of 1781, also known as the Act of
Settlement.
The features of this Act were as follows:
1.  It exempted the Governor-General and the Council from the
jurisdiction of the Supreme Court for the acts done by them in their
official capacity. Similarly, it also exempted the servants of the
company from the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court for their official
actions.
2.  It excluded the revenue matters and the matters arising in the
collection of revenue from the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.
3.  It provided that the Supreme Court was to have jurisdiction over all
the inhabitants of Culcutta. It also required the court to administer the
personal law of the defendants i.e., Hindus were to be tried according
to the Hindu law and Muslims were to be tried according to the
Mohammedan law.
4.  It laid down that the appeals from the Provincial Courts could be
taken to the Governor-General-in-Council and not to the Supreme
Court.
5.  It empowered the Governor-General-inCouncil to frame regulations
for the Provincial Courts and Councils.
Pitt’s India Act of 1784
The next important act was the Pitt’s India Act2
 of 1784.
The features of this Act were as follows:
1.  It distinguished between the commercial and political functions of
the Company.
2.  It allowed the Court of Directors to manage the commercial affairs,
but created a new body called Board of Control to manage the political
affairs. Thus, it established a system of double government.
3.  It empowered the Board of Control to supervise and direct all
operations of the civil and military government or revenues of the
British possessions in India.
Thus, the act was significant for two reasons: first, the Company’s
territories in India were for the first time called the ‘British possessions in
India’; and second, the British Government was given the supreme control
over Company’s affairs and its administration in India.
Act of 1786
In 1786, Lord Cornwallis was appointed as the Governor-General of
Bengal. He placed two demands to accept that post, viz.,
1.  He should be given power to override the decision of his council in
special cases.
2.  He would also be the Commander-in-Chief.
Accordingly, the Act of 1786 was enacted to make both the provisions.
Charter Act of 1793
The features of this Act were as follows:
1.  It extended the overriding power given to Lord Cornwallis over his
council, to all future Governor-Generals and Governors of
Presidencies.
2.  It gave the Governor-General more powers and control over the
governments of the subordinate Presidencies of Bombay and Madras.
3.  It extended the trade monopoly of the Company in India for another
period of twenty years.
4.  It provided that the Commander-in-Chief was not to be a member
of the Governor-General’s council, unless he was so appointed.
5.  It laid down that the members of the Board of Control and their
staff were, henceforth, to be paid out of the Indian revenues.
Charter Act of 1813
The features of this Act were as follows:
1.  It abolished the trade monopoly of the company in India i.e., the
Indian trade was thrown open to all British merchants. However, it
continued the monopoly of the company over trade in tea and trade
with China.
2.  It asserted the sovereignty of the British Crown over the Company’s
territories in India.
3.  It allowed the Christian missionaries to come to India for the
purpose of enlightening the people.
4.  It provided for the spread of western education among the
inhabitants of the British territories in India.
5.  It authorised the Local Governments in India to impose taxes on
persons. They could also punish the persons for not paying taxes.
Charter Act of 1833
This Act was the final step towards centralisation in British India.
The features of this Act were as follows:
1.  It made the Governor-General of Bengal as the Governor-General
of India and vested in him all civil and military powers. Thus, the act
created, for the first time, Government of India having authority over
the entire territorial area possessed by the British in India. Lord
William Bentick was the first Governor-General of India.
2.  It deprived the Governor of Bombay and Madras of their legislative
powers. The Governor-General of India was given exclusive
legislative powers for the entire British India. The laws made under the
previous acts were called as Regulations, while laws made under this
act were called as Acts.
3.  It ended the activities of the East India Company as a commercial
body, which became a purely administrative body. It provided that the
Company’s territories in India were held by it ‘in trust for His Majesty,
His heirs and successors’.
4.  The Charter Act of 1833 attempted to introduce a system of open
competition for selection of civil servants and stated that the Indians
should not be debarred from holding any place, office and employment
under the Company. However, this provision was negated after
opposition from the Court of Directors.
Charter Act of 1853
This was the last of the series of Charter Acts passed by the British
Parliament between 1793 and 1853. It was a significant constitutional
landmark.
The features of this Act were as follows:
1.  It separated, for the first time, the legislative and executive
functions of the Governor-General’s council. It provided for addition
of six new members called legislative councillors to the council. In
other words, it established a separate Governor-General’s legislative
council which came to be known as the Indian (Central) Legislative
Council. This legislative wing of the council functioned as a miniParliament, adopting the same procedures as the British Parliament.
Thus, legislation, for the first time, was treated as a special function of
the government, requiring special machinery and special process.
2.  It introduced an open competition system of selection and
recruitment of civil servants. The covenanted civil service3 was, thus,
thrown open to the Indians also. Accordingly, the Macaulay
Committee (the Committee on the Indian Civil Service) was appointed
in 1854.
3.  It extended the Company’s rule and allowed it to retain the
possession of Indian territories on trust for the British Crown. But, it
did not specify any particular period, unlike the previous Charters.
This was a clear indication that the Company’s rule could be
terminated at any time the Parliament liked.
4.  It introduced, for the first time, local representation in the Indian
(Central) Legislative Council. Of the six new legislative members of
the GovernorGeneral’s council, four members were appointed by the
local (provincial) governments of Madras, Bombay, Bengal and Agra.
THE CROWN RULE (1858–1947)
Government of India Act of 1858
This significant Act was enacted in the wake of the Revolt of 1857–also
known as the First War of Independence or the ‘sepoy mutiny’. The act
known as the Act for the Good Government of India, abolished the East
India Company, and transferred the powers of Government, territories and
revenues to the British Crown.
The features of this Act were as follows:
1.  It provided that India, henceforth, was to be governed by, and in the
name of, Her Majesty. It changed the designation of the GovernorGeneral of India to that of Viceroy of India. He (Viceroy) was the
direct representative of the British Crown in India. Lord Canning, thus,
became the first Viceroy of India.
2.  It ended the system of double Government by abolishing the Board
of Control and Court of Directors.
3.  It created a new office, Secretary of State for India, vested with
complete authority and control over Indian administration. The
secretary of state was a member of the British Cabinet and was
responsible ultimately to the British Parliament.
4.  It established a 15-member council of India to assist the Secretary
of State for India. The council was an advisory body. The secretary of
state was made the Chairman of the council.
5.  It constituted the Secretary of State-inCouncil as a body corporate,
capable of suing and being sued in India and in England.
‘The Act of 1858 was, however, largely confined to the improvement of
the administrative machinery by which the Indian Government was to be
supervised and controlled in England. It did not alter in any substantial way
the system of Government that prevailed in India4
 .’
Indian Councils Act of 1861
After the great revolt of 1857, the British Government felt the necessity of
seeking the cooperation of the Indians in the administration of their country.
In pursuance of this policy of association, three acts were enacted by the
British Parliament in 1861, 1892 and 1909. The Indian Councils Act of
1861 is an important landmark in the constitutional and political history of
India.
The features of this Act were as follows:
1.  It made a beginning of the representative institutions by associating
Indians with the law-making process. It, thus, provided that the
Viceroy should nominate some Indians as non-official members of his
expanded council. In 1862, Lord Canning, the then Viceroy, nominated
three Indians to his legislative council–the Raja of Benaras, the
Maharaja of Patiala and Sir Dinkar Rao.
2.  It initiated the process of decentralisation by restoring the
legislative powers to the Bombay and Madras Presidencies. It, thus,
reversed the centralising tendency that started from the Regulating Act
of 1773 and reached its climax under the Charter Act of 1833. This
policy of legislative devolution resulted in the grant of almost
complete internal autonomy to the provinces in 1937.
3.  It also provided for the establishment of new legislative councils for
Bengal, North-Western Provinces and Punjab, which were established
in 1862, 1886 and 1897, respectively.
4.  It empowered the Viceroy to make rules and orders for the more
convenient transaction of business in the council. It also gave a
recognition to the ‘portfolio’ system, introduced by Lord Canning in
1859. Under this, a member of the Viceroy’s council was made incharge of one or more departments of the Government and was
authorised to issue final orders on behalf of the council on matters of
his department(s).
5.  It empowered the Viceroy to issue ordinances, without the
concurrence of the legislative council, during an emergency. The life
of such an ordinance was six months.
Indian Councils Act of 1892
The features of this Act were as follows:
1.  It increased the number of additional (non-official) members in the
Central and provincial legislative councils, but maintained the official
majority in them.
2.  It increased the functions of legislative councils and gave them the
power of discussing the budget5 and addressing questions to the
executive.
3.  It provided for the nomination of some non-official members of the
(a) Central Legislative Council by the viceroy on the recommendation
of the provincial legislative councils and the Bengal Chamber of
Commerce, and (b) that of the provincial legislative councils by the
Governors on the recommendation of the district boards,
municipalities, universities, trade associations, zamin-dars and
chambers.
‘The act made a limited and indirect provision for the use of election in
filling up some of the non-official seats both in the Central and provincial
legislative councils. The word “election” was, however, not used in the Act.
The process was described as nomination made on the recommendation of
certain bodies6
 .’
Indian Councils Act of 1909
This Act is also known as Morley-Minto Reforms (Lord Morley was the
then Secretary of State for India and Lord Minto was the then Viceroy of
India).
The features of this Act were as follows:
1.  It considerably increased the size of the legislative councils, both
Central and provincial. The number of members in the Central
legislative council was raised from 16 to 60. The number of members
in the provincial legislative councils was not uniform.
2.  It retained official majority in the Central legislative council, but
allowed the provincial legislative councils to have non-official
majority.
3.  It enlarged the deliberative functions of the legislative councils at
both the levels. For example, members were allowed to ask
supplementary questions, move resolutions on the budget and so on.
4.  It provided (for the first time) for the association of Indians with the
executive councils of the Viceroy and Governors. Satyendra Prasad
Sinha became the first Indian to join the Viceroy’s executive council.
He was appointed as the Law Member.
5.  It introduced a system of communal representation for Muslims by
accepting the concept of ‘separate electorate’. Under this, the Muslim
members were to be elected only by Muslim voters. Thus, the Act
‘legalised communalism’ and Lord Minto came to be known as the
Father of Communal Electorate.
6.  It also provided for the separate representation of presidency
corporations, chambers of commerce, universities and zamindars.
Government of India Act of 1919
On August 20, 1917, the British Government declared, for the first time,
that its objective was the gradual introduction of responsible Government in
India7
 .
The Government of India Act of 1919 was thus enacted, which came into
force in 1921. This Act is also known as Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms
(Montagu was the Secretary of State for India and Lord Chelmsford was the
Viceroy of India).
The features of this Act were as follows:
1.  It relaxed the central control over the provinces by demarcating and
separating the central and provincial subjects. The central and
provincial legislatures were authorised to make laws on their
respective list of subjects. However, the structure of government
continued to be centralised and unitary.
2.  It further divided the provincial subjects into two parts–transferred
and reserved. The transferred subjects were to be administered by the
Governor with the aid of Ministers responsible to the legislative
council. The reserved subjects, on the other hand, were to be
administered by the Governor and his executive council without being
responsible to the legislative council. This dual scheme of governance
was known as ‘dyarchy’–a term derived from the Greek word di-arche
which means double rule. However, this experiment was largely
unsuccessful.
3.  It introduced, for the first time, bicameralism and direct elections in
the country. Thus, the Indian legislative council was replaced by a
bicameral legislature consisting of an Upper House (Council of State)
and a Lower House (Legislative Assembly). The majority of members
of both the Houses were chosen by direct election.
4.  It required that the three of the six members of the Viceroy’s
executive Council (other than the Commander-in-Chief) were to be
Indian.
5.  It extended the principle of communal representation by providing
separate electorates for Sikhs, Indian Christians, Anglo-Indians and
Europeans.
6.  It granted franchise to a limited number of people on the basis of
property, tax or education.
7.  It created a new office of the High Commissioner for India in
London and transferred to him some of the functions hitherto
performed by the Secretary of State for India.
8.  It provided for the establishment of a public service commission.
Hence, a Central Public Service Commission was set up in 1926 for
recruiting civil servants8
 .
9.  It separated, for the first time, provincial budgets from the Central
budget and authorised the provincial legislatures to enact their budgets.
10.  It provided for the appointment of a statutory commission to
inquire into and report on its working after ten years of its coming into
force.
Simon Commission
In November 1927 itself (i.e., 2 years before the schedule), the British
Government announced the appointment a seven-member statutory
commission under the chairmanship of Sir John Simon to report on the
condition of India under its new Constitution. All the members of the
commission were British and hence, all the parties boycotted the
commission. The commission submitted its report in 1930 and
recommended the abolition of dyarchy, extension of responsible
Government in the provinces, establishment of a federation of British India
and princely states, continuation of communal electorate and so on. To
consider the proposals of the commission, the British Government
convened three round table conferences of the representatives of the British
Government, British India and Indian princely states. On the basis of these
discussions, a ‘White Paper on Consitutional Reforms’ was prepared and
submitted for the consideration of the Joint Select Committee of the British
Parliament. The recommendations of this committee were incorporated
(with certain changes) in the next Government of India Act of 1935.
Communal Award
In August 1932, Ramsay MacDonald, the British Prime Minister,
announced a scheme of representation of the minorities, which came to be
known as the Communal Award. The award not only continued separate
electorates for the Muslims, Sikhs, Indian Christians, Anglo-Indians and
Europeans but also extended it to the depressed classes (Scheduled Castes).
Gandhiji was distressed over this extension of the principle of communal
representation to the depressed classes and undertook fast unto death in
Yerawada Jail (Poona) to get the award modified. At last, there was an
agreement between the leaders of the Congress and the depressed classes.
The agreement, known as Poona Pact, retained the Hindu joint electorate
and gave reserved seats to the depressed classes.
Government of India Act of 1935
The Act marked a second milestone towards a completely responsible
government in India. It was a lengthy and detailed document having 321
Sections and 10 Schedules.
The features of this Act were as follows:
1.  It provided for the establishment of an All-India Federation
consisting of provinces and princely states as units. The Act divided
the powers between the Centre and units in terms of three lists–Federal
List (for Centre, with 59 items), Provincial List (for provinces, with 54
items) and the Concurrent List (for both, with 36 items). Residuary
powers were given to the Viceroy. However, the federation never came
into being as the princely states did not join it.
2.  It abolished dyarchy in the provinces and introduced ‘provincial
autonomy’ in its place. The provinces were allowed to act as
autonomous units of administration in their defined spheres. Moreover,
the Act introduced responsible Governments in provinces, that is, the
Governor was required to act with the advice of ministers responsible
to the provincial legislature. This came into effect in 1937 and was
discontinued in 1939.
3.  It provided for the adoption of dyarchy at the Centre. Consequently,
the federal subjects were divided into reserved subjects and transferred
subjects. However, this provision of the Act did not come into
operation at all.
4.  It introduced bicameralism in six out of eleven provinces. Thus, the
legislatures of Bengal, Bombay, Madras, Bihar, Assam and the United
Provinces were made bicameral consisting of a legislative council
(upper house) and a legislative assembly (lower house). However,
many restrictions were placed on them.
5.  It further extended the principle of communal representation by
providing separate electorates for depressed classes (Scheduled
Castes), women and labour (workers).
6.  It abolished the Council of India, established by the Government of
India Act of 1858. The secretary of state for India was provided with a
team of advisors.
7.  It extended franchise. About 10 per cent of the total population got
the voting right.
8.  It provided for the establishment of a Reserve Bank of India to
control the currency and credit of the country.
9.  It provided for the establishment of not only a Federal Public
Service Commission, but also a Provincial Public Service Commission
and Joint Public Service Commission for two or more provinces.
10.  It provided for the establishment of a Federal Court, which was set
up in 1937.
Indian Independence Act of 1947
On February 20, 1947, the British Prime Minister Clement Atlee declared
that the British rule in India would end by June 30,1948; after which the
power would be transferred to responsible Indian hands. This
announcement was followed by the agitation by the Muslim League
demanding partition of the country. Again on June 3, 1947, the British
Government made it clear that any Constitution framed by the Constituent
Assembly of India (formed in 1946) cannot apply to those parts of the
country which were unwilling to accept it. On the same day (June 3, 1947),
Lord Mountbatten, the Viceroy of India, put forth the partition plan, known
as the Mountbatten Plan. The plan was accepted by the Congress and the
Muslim League. Immediate effect was given to the plan by enacting the
Indian Independence Act9
 (1947).
The features of this Act were as follows:
1.  It ended the British rule in India and declared India as an
independent and sovereign state from August 15, 1947.
2.  It provided for the partition of India and creation of two
independent dominions of India and Pakistan with the right to secede
from the British Commonwealth.
3.  It abolished the office of Viceroy and provided, for each dominion,
a governorgeneral, who was to be appointed by the British King on the
advice of the dominion cabinet. His Majesty’s Government in Britain
was to have no responsibility with respect to the Government of India
or Pakistan.
4.  It empowered the Constituent Assemblies of the two dominions to
frame and adopt any constitution for their respective nations and to
repeal any act of the British Parliament, including the Independence
act itself.
5.  It empowered the Constituent Assemblies of both the dominions to
legislate for their respective territories till the new constitutions were
drafted and enforced. No Act of the British Parliament passed after
August 15, 1947 was to extend to either of the new dominions unless it
was extended thereto by a law of the legislature of the dominion.
6.  It abolished the office of the Secretary of State for India and
transferred his functions to the Secretary of State for Commonwealth
Affairs.
7.  It proclaimed the lapse of British paramountcy over the Indian
princely states and treaty relations with tribal areas from August 15,
1947.
8.  It granted freedom to the Indian princely states either to join the
Dominion of India or Dominion of Pakistan or to remain independent.
9.  It provided for the governance of each of the dominions and the
provinces by the Government of India Act of 1935, till the new
Constitutions were framed. The dominions were however authorised to
make modifications in the Act.
10.  It deprived the British Monarch of his right to veto bills or ask for
reservation of certain bills for his approval. But, this right was reserved
for the GovernorGeneral. The Governor-General would have full
power to assent to any bill in the name of His Majesty.
11.  It designated the Governor-General of India and the provincial
governors as constitutional (nominal) heads of the states. They were
made to act on the advice of the respective council of ministers in all
matters.
12.  It dropped the title of Emperor of India from the royal titles of the
King of England.
13.  It discontinued the appointment to civil services and reservation of
posts by the secretary of state for India. The members of the civil
services appointed before August 15, 1947 would continue to enjoy all
benefits that they were entitled to till that time.
At the stroke of midnight of 14-15 August, 1947, the British rule came to
an end and power was transferred to the two new independent Dominions
of India and Pakistan10
. Lord Mountbatten became the first
GovernorGeneral of the new Dominion of India. He swore in Jawaharlal
Nehru as the first Prime Minister of independent India. The Constituent
Assembly of India formed in 1946 became the Parliament of the Indian
Dominion.

2 Making of the Constitution
DEMAND FOR A CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY
It was in 1934 that the idea of a Constituent Assembly for India was put
forward for the first time by M.N. Roy, a pioneer of communist movement
in India. In 1935, the Indian National Congress (INC), for the first time,
officially demanded a Constituent Assembly to frame the Constitution of
India. In 1938, Jawaharlal Nehru, on behalf the INC declared that ‘the
Constitution of free India must be framed, without outside interference, by a
Constituent Assembly elected on the basis of adult franchise’.
The demand was finally accepted in principle by the British Government
in what is known as the ‘August Offer’ of 1940. In 1942, Sir Stafford
Cripps, a Member of the Cabinet, came to India with a draft proposal of the
British Government on the framing of an independent Constitution to be
adopted after the World War II. The Cripps Proposals were rejected by the
Muslim League, which wanted India to be divided into two autonomous
states with two separate Constituent Assemblies. Finally, a Cabinet Mission1
was sent to India. While it rejected the idea of two Constituent Assemblies,
it put forth a scheme for the Constituent Assembly which more or less
satisfied the Muslim League.
COMPOSITION OF THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY
The Constituent Assembly was constituted in November 1946 under the
scheme formulated by the Cabinet Mission Plan.
The features of the scheme were:
1.  The total strength of the Constituent Assembly was to be 389. Of
these, 296 seats were to be allotted to British India and 93 seats to the
princely states. Out of 296 seats allotted to the British India, 292
members were to be drawn from the eleven governors’ provinces2 and
four from the four Chief Commissioners’ provinces3
 , one from each.
2.  Each province and princely state (or group of states in case of small
states) were to be allotted seats in proportion to their respective
population. Roughly, one seat was to be allotted for every million
population.
3.  Seats allocated to each British province were to be divided among
the three principal communities–Muslims, Sikhs and General (all
except Muslims and Sikhs), in proportion to their population.
4.  The representatives of each community were to be elected by
members of that community in the provincial legislative assembly and
voting was to be by the method of proportional representation by
means of single transferable vote.
5.  The representatives of the princely states were to be nominated by
the heads of the princely states.
It is, thus, clear that the Constituent Assembly was to be a partly elected
and partly nominated body. Moreover, the members were to be indirectly
elected by the members of the provincial assemblies, who themselves were
elected on a limited franchise4
 .
The elections to the Constituent Assembly (for 296 seats allotted to the
British Indian Provinces) were held in July-August 1946. The Indian
National Congress won 208 seats, the Muslim League 73 seats and the
small groups and independents got the remaining 15 seats. However, the 93
seats allotted to the princely states were not filled as they decided to stay
away from the Constituent Assembly.
Although the Constituent Assembly was not directly elected by the
people of India on the basis of adult franchise, the Assembly comprised
representatives of all sections of the Indian society–Hindus, Muslims,
Sikhs, Parsis, Anglo-Indians, Indian Christians, SCs, STs including women
of all these sections. The Assembly included all important personalities of
India at that time, with the exception of Mahatma Gandhi.
WORKING OF THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY
The Constituent Assembly held its first meeting on December 9, 1946. The
Muslim League boycotted the meeting and insisted on a separate state of
Pakistan. The meeting was, thus, attended by only 211 members. Dr.
Sachchidananda Sinha, the oldest member, was elected as the temporary
President of the Assembly, following the French practice.
Later, Dr. Rajendra Prasad was elected as the President of the Assembly.
Similarly, both H.C. Mukherjee and V.T. Krishnamachari were elected as
the Vice-Presidents of the Assembly. In other words, the Assembly had two
Vice-Presidents.
Objectives Resolution
On December 13, 1946, Jawaharlal Nehru moved the historic ‘Objectives
Resolution’ in the Assembly. It laid down the fundamentals and philosophy
of the constitutional structure. It read:
1.  “This Constituent Assembly declares its firm and solemn resolve to
proclaim India as an Independent Sovereign Republic and to draw up
for her future governance a Constitution:
2.  Wherein the territories that now comprise British India, the
territories that now form the Indian States and such other parts of India
as are outside India and the States as well as other territories as are
willing to be constituted into the independent sovereign India, shall be
a Union of them all; and
3.  wherein the said territories, whether with their present boundaries
or with such others as may be determined by the Constituent Assembly
and thereafter according to the law of the Constitution, shall possess
and retain the status of autonomous units together with residuary
powers and exercise all powers and functions of Government and
administration save and except such powers and functions as are
vested in or assigned to the Union or as are inherent or implied in the
Union or resulting therefrom; and
4.  wherein all power and authority of the sovereign independent India,
its constituent parts and organs of Government are derived from the
people; and
5.  wherein shall be guaranteed and secured to all the people of India
justice, social, economic and political; equality of status of
opportunity, and before the law; freedom of thought, expression,
belief, faith, worship, vocation, association and action, subject to law
and public morality; and
6.  wherein adequate safeguards shall be provided for minorities,
backward and tribal areas, and depressed and other backward classes;
and
7.  whereby shall be maintained the integrity of the territory of the
Republic and its sovereign rights on land, sea and air according to
justice and the law of civilized nations; and
8.  This ancient land attains its rightful and honoured place in the
world and makes its full and willing contribution to the promotion of
world peace and the welfare of mankind.”
This Resolution was unanimously adopted by the Assembly on January
22, 1947. It influenced the eventual shaping of the constitution through all
its subsequent stages. Its modified version forms the Preamble of the
present Constitution.
Changes by the Independence Act
The representatives of the princely states, who had stayed away from the
Constituent Assembly, gradually joined it. On April 28, 1947,
representatives of the six states5 were part of the Assembly. After the
acceptance of the Mountbatten Plan of June 3, 1947, for the partition of the
country, the representatives of most of the other princely states took their
seats in the Assembly. The members of the Muslim League from the Indian
Dominion also entered the Assembly.
The Indian Independence Act of 1947 made the following three changes
in the position of the Assembly:
1.  The Assembly was made a fully sovereign body, which could frame
any Constitution it pleased. The act empowered the Assembly to
abrogate or alter any law made by the British Parliament in relation to
India.
2.  The Assembly also became a legislative body. In other words, two
separate functions were assigned to the Assembly, that is, making of
the Constitution for free India and enacting of ordinary laws for the
country. These two tasks were to be performed on separate days. Thus,
the Assembly became the first Parliament of free India (Dominion
Legislature). Whenever the Assembly met as the Constituent body it
was chaired by Dr. Rajendra Prasad and when it met as the legislative
body6
, it was chaired by G.V. Mavlankar. These two functions
continued till November 26, 1949, when the task of making the
Constitution was over.
3.  The Muslim League members (hailing from the areas7
included in
the Pakistan) withdrew from the Constituent Assembly for India.
Consequently, the total strength of the Assembly came down to 299 as
against 389 originally fixed in 1946 under the Cabinet Mission Plan.
The strength of the Indian provinces (formerly British Provinces) was
reduced from 296 to 229 and those of the princely states from 93 to 70.
The state-wise membership of the Assembly as on December 31, 1947,
is shown in Table 2.4 of this chapter.
Other Functions Performed
In addition to the making of the Constitution and enacting of ordinary laws,
the Constituent Assembly also performed the following functions:
1.  It ratified the India’s membership of the Commonwealth in May
1949.
2.  It adopted the national flag on July 22, 1947.
3.  It adopted the national anthem on January 24, 1950.
4.  It adopted the national song on January 24, 1950.
5.  It elected Dr. Rajendra Prasad as the first President of India on
January 24, 1950.
In all, the Constituent Assembly had 11 sessions over two years, 11
months and 18 days. The Constitution-makers had gone through the
Constitutions of about 60 countries, and the Draft Constitution was
considered for 114 days. The total expenditure incurred on making the
Constitution amounted to ₹64 lakh.
On January 24, 1950, the Constituent Assembly held its final session. It,
however, did not end, and continued as the provisional parliament of India
from January 26, 1950, till the formation of new Parliament8 after the first
general elections in 1951–52.
COMMITTEES OF THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY
The Constituent Assembly appointed a number of committees to deal with
different tasks of constitution-making. Out of these, eight were major
committees and the others were minor committees. The names of these

Drafting Committee
Among all the committees of the Constituent Assembly, the most important
committee was the Drafting Committee set up on August 29, 1947. It was
this committee that was entrusted with the task of preparing a draft of the
new Constitution. It consisted of seven members. They were:
1.  Dr. B.R. Ambedkar (Chairman)
2.  N. Gopalaswamy Ayyangar
3.  Alladi Krishnaswamy Ayyar
4.  Dr. K.M. Munshi
5.  Syed Mohammad Saadullah
6.  N. Madhava Rau (He replaced B.L. Mitter who resigned due to illhealth)
7.  T.T. Krishnamachari (He replaced D.P. Khaitan who died in 1948)
The Drafting Committee, after taking into consideration the proposals of
the various committees, prepared the first draft of the Constitution of India,
which was published in February, 1948. The people of India were given
eight months to discuss the draft and propose amendments. In the light of
the public comments, criticisms and suggestions, the Drafting Committee
prepared a second draft, which was published in October, 1948.
The Drafting Committee took less than six months to prepare its draft. In
all it sat only for 141 days.
ENACTMENT OF THE CONSTITUTION
Dr. B.R. Ambedkar introduced the final draft of the Constitution in the
Assembly on November 4, 1948 (first reading). The Assembly had a
general discussion on it for five days (till November 9, 1948).
The second reading (clause by clause consideration) started on November
15, 1948, and ended on October 17, 1949. During this stage, as many as
7653 amendments were proposed and 2473 were actually discussed in the
Assembly.
The third reading of the draft started on November 14, 1949. Dr. B.R.
Ambedkar moved a motion–‘the Constitution as settled by the Assembly be
passed’. The motion on Draft Constitution was declared as passed on
November 26, 1949, and received the signatures of the members and the
president. Out of a total 299 members of the Assembly, only 284 were
actually present on that day and signed the Constitution. This is also the
date mentioned in the Preamble as the date on which the people of India in
the Constituent Assembly adopted, enacted and gave to themselves this
Constitution.
The Constitution as adopted on November 26, 1949, contained a
Preamble, 395 Articles and 8 Schedules. The Preamble was enacted after
the entire Constitution was already enacted.
Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, the then Law Minister, piloted the Draft Constitution
in the Assembly. He took a very prominent part in the deliberations of the
Assembly. He was known for his logical, forceful and persuasive arguments
on the floor of the Assembly. He is recognised as the ‘Father of the
Constitution of India’. This brilliant writer, constitutional expert,
undisputed leader of the Scheduled Castes and the ‘chief architect of the
Constitution of India’ is also known as a ‘Modern Manu’.
ENFORCEMENT OF THE CONSTITUTION
Some provisions of the Constitution pertaining to citizenship, elections,
provisional parliament, temporary and transitional provisions, and short title
contained in Articles 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 60, 324, 366, 367, 379, 380, 388, 391,
392 and 393 came into force on November 26, 1949, itself.
The remaining provisions (the major part) of the Constitution came into
force on January 26, 1950. This day is referred to in the Constitution as the
‘date of its commencement’, and celebrated as the Republic Day.
January 26 was specifically chosen as the ‘date of commencement’ of the
Constitution because of its historical importance. It was on this day in 1930
that Purna Swaraj day was celebrated, following the resolution of the
Lahore Session (December 1929) of the INC.
With the commencement of the Constitution, the Indian Independence
Act of 1947 and the Government of India Act of 1935, with all enactments
amending or supplementing the latter Act, were repealed. The Abolition of
Privy Council Jurisdiction Act (1949) was however continued.
EXPERTS COMMITTEE OF THE CONGRESS
While elections to the Constituent Assembly were still in progress, on July
8, 1946, the Congress Party (Indian National Congress) appointed an
Experts Committee for the purpose of preparing material for the Constituent
Assembly. This committee consisted of the following members8b
 :
1.  Jawaharlal Nehru (Chairman)
2.  M. Asaf Ali
3.  K.M. Munshi
4.  N. Gopalaswami Ayyangar
5.  K.T. Shah
6.  D.R. Gadgil
7.  Humayun Kabir
8.  K. Santhanam
Later, on the Chairman’s proposal, it was resolved that Krishna Kripalani
be co-opted as member and convener of the committee.
The committee had two sittings, the first at New Delhi from July 20 to
22, 1946, and the second at Bombay from August 15 to 17, 1946.
Apart from a number of notes prepared by its members, the committee
discussed the procedure to be adopted by the Constituent Assembly, the
question of the appointment of various committees and the draft of a
resolution on the objectives of the constitution to be moved during the first
session of the Constituent Assembly8c
 .
On the role played by this committee in the making of the Constitution,
Granville Austin, a British constitutional expert, observed: “It was the
Congress Experts Committee that set India on the road to her present
Constitution. The committee members, working within the framework of
the Cabinet Mission Scheme, made general suggestions about autonomous
areas, the powers of provincial Governments and the Centre, and about such
issues as the princely states and the amending power. They also drafted a
resolution, closely resembling the Objectives Resolution”.8d
CRITICISM OF THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY
The critics have criticised the Constituent Assembly on various grounds.
These are as follows:
1.  Not a Representative Body: The critics have argued that the
Constituent Assembly was not a representative body as its members
were not directly elected by the people of India on the basis of
universal adult franchise.
2.  Not a Sovereign Body: The critics maintained that the Constituent
Assembly was not a sovereign body as it was created by the proposals
of the British Government. Further, they said that the Assembly held
its sessions with the permission of the British Government.
3.  Time Consuming: According to the critics, the Constituent
Assembly took unduly long time to make the Constitution. They stated
that the framers of the American Constitution took only four months to
complete their work8e
. In this context, Naziruddin Ahmed, a member of
the Constituent Assembly, coined a new name for the Drafting
Committee to show his contempt for it. He called it a “Drifting
Committee”.
4.  Dominated by Congress: The critics charged that the Constituent
Assembly was dominated by the Congress party. Granville Austin, an
American Constitutional expert, remarked: ‘The Constituent Assembly
was a one-party body in an essentially one-party country. The
Assembly was the Congress and the Congress was India’9
 .
5.  Lawyer-Politician Domination: It is also maintained by the critics
that the Constituent Assembly was dominated by lawyers and
politicians. They pointed out that other sections of the society were not
sufficiently represented. This, to them, is the main reason for the
bulkiness and complicated language of the Constitution.
6.  Dominated by Hindus: According to some critics, the Constituent
Assembly was a Hindu dominated body. Lord Viscount Simon called it
‘a body of Hindus’. Similarly, Winston Churchill commented that the
Constituent Assembly represented ‘only one major community in
India’.

HINDI TEXT OF THE CONSTITUTION
Originally, the Constitution of India did not make any provision with
respect to an authoritative text of the Constitution in the Hindi language.
Later, a provision in this regard was made by the 58th Constitutional
Amendment Act of 19878f
. This amendment inserted a new Article 394-A in
the last part of the Constitution i.e., Part XXII8g
. This article contains the
following provisions:
1.  The President shall cause to be published under his authority:
(i)  The translation of the Constitution in Hindi language. The
modifications which are necessary to bring it in conformity with the
language, style and terminology adopted in the authoritative texts of
the Central Acts in Hindi can be made in it. All the amendments of the
Constitution made before such publication should be incorporated in it.
(ii)  The translation in Hindi of every amendment of the constitution
made in English.
2.  The translation of the Constitution and its every amendment
published shall be construed to have the same meaning as the original
text in English. If any difficulty arises in this matter, the President shall
cause the Hindi text to be revised suitably.
3.  The translation of the Constitution and its every amendment
published shall be deemed to be, for all purposes, its authoritative text
in Hindi.

NOTES AND REFERENCES
1.  The Cabinet Mission consisting of three members (Lord Pethick
Lawrence, Sir Stafford Cripps and A.V. Alexander) arrived in India on
March 24, 1946. The Cabinet Mission published its plan on May 16,
1946.
2.  These include Madras, Bombay, UP, Bihar, Central Provinces,
Orissa, Punjab, NWFP, Sindh, Bengal and Assam.
3.  These include Delhi, Ajmer-Merwara, Coorg and British
Baluchistan.
4.  The Government of India Act of 1935 granted limited franchise on
the basis of tax, property and education.
5.  These include Baroda, Bikaner, Jaipur, Patiala, Rewa and Udaipur.
6.  For the first time, the Constituent Assembly met as Dominion
Legislature on November 17, 1947 and elected G.V. Mavlankar as its
speaker.
7.  These are West Punjab, East Bengal, NWFP, Sindh, Baluchistan
and Sylhet District of Assam. A separate Constituent Assembly was
set up for Pakistan.
8.  The Provisional Parliament ceased to exist on April 17, 1952. The
first elected Parliament with the two Houses came into being in May
1952.
8a.  One of the political consequences of the British Government’s
statement of June 3, 1947, was that following a referendum, the NorthWest Frontier Province and Baluchistan became part of the territory of
the Dominion of Pakistan and as a result the tribal areas in this region
became a concern of that Dominion. The Sub-Committee on the Tribal
Areas in the North-West Frontier Province and Baluchistan was not
therefore called upon to function on behalf of the Constituent
Assembly of India. (B. Shiva Rao, The Framing of India’s Constitution
: Select Documents, Volume III, P.681.)
The members of this Sub-Committee were : Khan Abdul Ghaffar
Khan, Khan Abdul Samad Khan and Mehr Chand Khanna. The
information about the Chairman is not found.

3 Salient Features of the Constitution
The Indian Constitution is unique in its contents and spirit. Though
borrowed from almost every Constitution of the world, the Constitution of
India has several salient features that distinguish it from the Constitutions of
the other countries.
It should be noted at the outset that a number of original features of the
Constitution (as adopted in 1949) have undergone a substantial change, on
account of several amendments, particularly 7th, 42nd, 44th, 73rd, 74th,
97th and 101st Amendments. In fact, the 42nd Amendment Act (1976) is
known as ‘Mini-Constitution’ due to the important and large number of
changes made by it in various parts of the Constitution. However, in the
Kesavananda Bharati case1
(1973), the Supreme Court ruled that the
constituent power of Parliament under Article 368 does not enable it to alter
the ‘basic structure’ of the Constitution.
SALIENT FEATURES OF THE CONSTITUTION
The salient features of the Constitution, as it stands today, are as follows:
1. Lengthiest Written Constitution
Constitutions are classified into written, like the American Constitution, or
unwritten, like the British Constitution. The Constitution of India is the
lengthiest of all the written Constitutions of the world. It is a very
comprehensive, elaborate and detailed document.
Originally (1949), the Constitution contained a Preamble, 395 Articles
(divided into 22 Parts) and 8 Schedules. Presently (2019), it consists of a
Preamble, about 470 Articles (divided into 25 Parts) and 12 Schedules2
. The
various amendments carried out since 1951 have deleted about 20 Articles
and one Part (VII) and added about 95 Articles, four Parts (IVA, IXA, IXB
and XIVA) and four Schedules (9, 10, 11 and 12). No other Constitution in
the world has so many Articles and Schedules3
 .
Four factors have contributed to the elephantine size of our Constitution.
They are:
(a)  Geographical factors, that is, the vastness of the country and its
diversity.
(b)  Historical factors, e.g., the influence of the Government of India
Act of 1935, which was bulky.
(c)  Single Constitution for both the Centre and the states4
 .
(d)  Dominance of legal luminaries in the Constituent Assembly.
The Constitution contains not only the fundamental principles of
governance, but also detailed administrative provisions. Further, those
matters which in other modern democratic countries have been left to the
ordinary legislation or established political conventions have also been
included in the constitutional document itself in India.
2. Drawn From Various Sources
The Constitution of India has borrowed most of its provisions from the
Constitutions of various other countries as well as from the Government of
India Act5 of 1935. Dr. B.R. Ambedkar proudly acclaimed that the
Constitution of India has been framed after ‘ransacking all the known
Constitutions of the World6
 ’.
The structural part of the Constitution is, to a large extent, derived from
the Government of India Act of 1935. The philosophical part of the
Constitution (the Fundamental Rights and the Directive Principles of State
Policy) derive their inspiration from the American and Irish Constitutions,
respectively. The political part of the Constitution (the principle of Cabinet
Government and the relations between the Executive and the Legislature)
have been largely drawn from the British Constitution7
 .
The other provisions of the Constitution have been drawn from the
Constitutions of Canada, Australia, Germany, USSR (now Russia), France,
South Africa, Japan and so on8
 .
The most profound influence and material source of the Constitution is
the Government of India Act, 1935. The Federal Scheme, Judiciary,
Governors, Emergency Powers, the Public Service Commissions and most
of the administrative details are drawn from this Act. More than half of the
provisions of Constitution are identical to or bear a close resemblance to the
Act of 19359
 .
3. Blend of Rigidity and Flexibility
Constitutions are also classified into rigid and flexible. A rigid Constitution
is one that requires a special procedure for its amendment, as for example,
the American Constitution. A flexible constitution, on the other hand, is one
that can be amended in the same manner as the ordinary laws are made, as
for example, the British Constitution.
The Constitution of India is neither rigid nor flexible, but a synthesis of
both. Article 368 provides for two types of amendments:
(a)  Some provisions can be amended by a special majority of the
Parliament, i.e., a two-third majority of the members of each House
present and voting, and a majority of the total membership of each
House.
(b)  Some other provisions can be amended by a special majority of the
Parliament and with the ratification by half of the total states.
At the same time, some provisions of the Constitution can be amended by
a simple majority of the Parliament in the manner of ordinary legislative
process. Notably, these amendments do not come under Article 368.
4. Federal System with Unitary Bias
The Constitution of India establishes a federal system of Government. It
contains all the usual features of a federation, viz., two Government,
division of powers, written Constitution, supremacy of Constitution, rigidity
of Constitution, independent judiciary and bicameralism.
However, the Indian Constitution also contains a large number of unitary
or non-federal features, viz., a strong Centre, single Constitution, single
citizenship, flexibility of Constitution, integrated judiciary, appointment of
state governor by the Centre, all-India services, emergency provisions and
so on.
Moreover, the term ‘Federation’ has nowhere been used in the
Constitution. Article 1, on the other hand, describes India as a ‘Union of
States’ which implies two things: one, Indian Federation is not the result of
an agreement by the states; and two, no state has the right to secede from
the federation.
Hence, the Indian Constitution has been variously described as ‘federal in
form but, unitary in spirit’, ‘quasi-federal’ by K.C. Wheare, ‘bargaining
federalism’ by Morris Jones, ‘co-operative federalism’ by Granville
Austin, ‘federation with a centralising tendency’ by Ivor Jennings and so
on.
5. Parliamentary Form of Government
The Constitution of India has opted for the British Parliamentary System of
Government rather than American Presidential System of Government. The
parliamentary system is based on the principle of co-operation and coordination between the legislative and executive organs while the
presidential system is based on the doctrine of separation of powers
between the two organs.
The parliamentary system is also known as the ‘Westminster’
10 Model of
Government, responsible Government and Cabinet Government. The
Constitution establishes the parliamentary system not only at the Centre, but
also in the states.
The features of parliamentary government in India are:
(a) Presence of nominal and real executives;
(b)  Majority party rule,
(c)  Collective responsibility of the executive to the legislature,
(d)  Membership of the ministers in the legislature,
(e)  Leadership of the Prime Minister or the Chief Minister,
(f)  Dissolution of the lower House (Lok Sabha or Assembly).
Even though the Indian parliamentary system is largely based on the
British pattern, there are some fundamental differences between the two.
For example, the Indian Parliament is not a sovereign body like the British
Parliament. Further, the Indian State has an elected head (republic) while
the British State has hereditary head (monarchy).
In a parliamentary system whether in India or Britain, the role of the
Prime Minister has become so significant and crucial that the political
scientists like to call it a ‘Prime Ministerial Government’.
6. Synthesis of Parliamentary Sovereignty and Judicial
Supremacy
The doctrine of sovereignty of Parliament is associated with the British
Parliament, while the principle of judicial supremacy with that of the
American Supreme Court.
Just as the Indian parliamentary system differs from the British system,
the scope of judicial review power of the Supreme Court in India is
narrower than that of what exists in US. This is because the American
Constitution provides for ‘due process of law’ against that of ‘procedure
established by law’ contained in the Indian Constitution (Article 21).
Therefore, the framers of the Indian Constitution have preferred a proper
synthesis between the British principle of parliamentary sovereignty and the
American principle of judicial supremacy. The Supreme Court, on the one
hand, can declare the parliamentary laws as unconstitutional through its
power of judicial review. The Parliament, on the other hand, can amend the
major portion of the Constitution through its constituent power.
7. Integrated and Independent Judiciary
The Indian Constitution establishes a judicial system that is integrated as
well as independent.
The Supreme Court stands at the top of the integrated judicial system in
the country. Below it, there are high courts at the state level. Under a high
court, there is a hierarchy of subordinate courts, that is, district courts and
other lower courts. This single system of courts enforces both the central
laws as well as the state laws, unlike in USA, where the federal laws are
enforced by the federal judiciary and the state laws are enforced by the state
judiciary.
The Supreme Court is a federal court, the highest court of appeal, the
guarantor of the fundamental rights of the citizens and the guardian of the
Constitution. Hence, the Constitution has made various provisions to ensure
its independence–security of tenure of the judges, fixed service conditions
for the judges, all the expenses of the Supreme Court charged on the
Consolidated Fund of India, prohibition on discussion on the conduct of
judges in the legislatures, ban on practice after retirement, power to punish
for its contempt vested in the Supreme Court, separation of the judiciary
from the executive, and so on.
8. Fundamental Rights
Part III of the Indian Constitution guarantees six11
fundamental rights to all
the citizens:
(a)  Right to Equality (Articles 14–18);
(b)  Right to Freedom (Articles 19–22);
(c)  Right against Exploitation (Articles 23–24);
(d)  Right to Freedom of Religion (Articles 25–28);
(e)  Cultural and Educational Rights (Articles 29–30); and
(f)  Right to Constitutional Remedies (Article 32).
The Fundamental Rights are meant for promoting the idea of political
democracy. They operate as limitations on the tyranny of the executive and
arbitrary laws of the legislature. They are justiciable in nature, that is, they
are enforceable by the courts for their violation. The aggrieved person can
directly go to the Supreme Court which can issue the writs of habeas
corpus, mandamus, prohibition, certiorari and quo warranto for the
restoration of his rights.
However, the Fundamental Rights are not absolute and subject to
reasonable restrictions. Further, they are not sacrosanct and can be curtailed
or repealed by the Parliament through a Constitutional Amendment Act.
They can also be suspended during the operation of a National Emergency
except the rights guaranteed by Articles 20 and 21.
9. Directive Principles of State Policy
According to Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, the Directive Principles of State Policy is
a ‘novel feature’ of the Indian Constitution. They are enumerated in Part IV
of the Constitution. They can be classified into three broad cat-egories–
socialistic, Gandhian and liberalintellectual.
The Directive Principles are meant for promoting the ideal of social and
economic democracy. They seek to establish a ‘welfare state’ in India.
However, unlike the Fundamental Rights, the directives are non-justiciable
in nature, that is, they are not enforceable by the courts for their violation.
Yet, the Constitution itself declares that ‘these principles are fundamental in
the governance of the country and it shall be the duty of the state to apply
these principles in making laws’. Hence, they impose a moral obligation on
the state authorities for their application. But, the real force (sanction)
behind them is political, that is, public opinion.
In the Minerva Mills case12
(1980), the Supreme Court held that ‘the
Indian Constitution is founded on the bedrock of the balance between the
Fundamental Rights and the Directive Principles’.
10. Fundamental Duties
The original constitution did not provide for the Fundamental Duties of the
citizens. These were added during the operation of internal emergency
(1975–77) by the 42nd Constitutional Amendment Act of 1976 on the
recommendation of the Swaran Singh Committee. The 86th Constitutional
Amendment Act of 2002 added one more fundamental duty.
The Part IV-A of the Constitution (which consists of only one Article 51-
A) specifies the eleven Fundamental Duties viz., to respect the Constitution,
national flag and national anthem; to protect the sovereignty, unity and
integrity of the country; to promote the spirit of common brotherhood
amongst all the people; to preserve the rich heritage of our composite
culture and so on.
The fundamental duties serve as a reminder to citizens that while
enjoying their rights, they have also to be quite conscious of duties they
owe to their country, their society and to their fellow-citizens. However,
like the Directive Principles, the duties are also non-justiciable in nature.
11. A Secular State
The Constitution of India stands for a Secular State. Hence, it does not
uphold any particular religion as the official religion of the Indian State.
The following provisions of the Constitution reveal the secular character of
the Indian State:
(a)  The term ‘secular’ was added to the Preamble of the Indian
Constitution by the 42nd Constitutional Amendment Act of 1976.
(b)  The Preamble secures to all citizens of India liberty of belief, faith
and worship.
(c)  The State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or
equal protection of the laws (Article 14).
(d)  The State shall not discriminate against any citizen on the ground
of religion (Article 15).
(e)  Equality of opportunity for all citizens in matters of public
employment (Article 16).
(f)  All persons are equally entitled to freedom of conscience and the
right to freely profess, practice and propagate any religion (Article 25).
(g)  Every religious denomination or any of its section shall have the
right to manage its religious affairs (Article 26).
(h)  No person shall be compelled to pay any taxes for the promotion
of a particular religion (Article 27).
(i)  No religious instruction shall be provided in any educational
institution maintained by the State (Article 28).
(j)  Any section of the citizens shall have the right to conserve its
distinct language, script or culture (Article 29).
(k)  All minorities shall have the right to establish and administer
educational institutions of their choice (Article 30).
(l)  The State shall endeavour to secure for all the citizens a Uniform
Civil Code (Article 44).
The Western concept of secularism connotes a complete separation
between the religion (the church) and the state (the politics). This negative
concept of secularism is inapplicable in the Indian situation where the
society is multireligious. Hence, the Indian Constitution embodies the
positive concept of secularism, i.e., giving equal respect to all religions or
protecting all religions equally.
Moreover, the Constitution has also abolished the old system of
communal repre-sentation13
, that is, reservation of seats in the legislatures
on the basis of religion. However, it provides for the temporary reservation
of seats for the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes to ensure adequate
representation to them.
12. Universal Adult Franchise
The Indian Constitution adopts universal adult franchise as a basis of
elections to the Lok Sabha and the state legislative assemblies. Every
citizen who is not less than 18 years of age has a right to vote without any
discrimination of caste, race, religion, sex, literacy, wealth and so on. The
voting age was reduced to 18 years from 21 years in 1989 by the 61st
Constitutional Amendment Act of 1988.
The introduction of universal adult franchise by the Constitution-makers
was a bold experiment and highly remarkable in view of the vast size of the
country, its huge population, high poverty, social inequality and
overwhelming illiteracy.
14
Universal adult franchise makes democracy broad-based, enhances the
self-respect and prestige of the common people, upholds the principle of
equality, enables minorities to protect their interests and opens up new
hopes and vistas for weaker sections.
13. Single Citizenship
Though the Indian Constitution is federal and envisages a dual polity
(Centre and states), it provides for only a single citizenship, that is, the
Indian citizenship.
In countries like USA, on the other hand, each person is not only a
citizen of USA, but also a citizen of the particular state to which he belongs.
Thus, he owes allegiance to both and enjoys dual sets of rights–one
conferred by the National government and another by the state government.
In India, all citizens irrespective of the state in which they are born or
reside enjoy the same political and civil rights of citizenship all over the
country and no discrimination is made between them.
Despite the constitutional provision for a single citizenship and uniform
rights for all the people, India has been witnessing the communal riots,
class conflicts, caste wars, linguistic clashes and ethnic disputes. This
means that the cherished goal of the Constitution-makers to build a united
and integrated Indian nation has not been fully realised.
14. Independent Bodies
The Indian Constitution not only provides for the legislative, executive and
judicial organs of the Government (Central and state) but also establishes
certain independent bodies. They are envisaged by the Constitution as the
bulkworks of the democratic system of Government in India. These are:
(a)  Election Commission to ensure free and fair elections to the
Parliament, the state legislatures, the office of President of India and
the office of Vice-president of India.
(b)  Comptroller and Auditor-General of India to audit the accounts of
the Central and state governments. He acts as the guardian of public
purse and comments on the legality and propriety of Government
expenditure.
(c)  Union Public Service Commission to conduct examinations for
recruitment to all-India services15 and higher Central services and to
advise the President on disciplinary matters.
(d)  State Public Service Commission in every state to conduct
examinations for recruitment to state services and to advice the
governor on disciplinary matters.
The Constitution ensures the independence of these bodies through
various provisions like security of tenure, fixed service conditions, expenses
being charged on the Consolidated Fund of India, and so on.
15. Emergency Provisions
The Indian Constitution contains elaborate emergency provisions to enable
the President to meet any extraordinary situation effectively. The rationality
behind the incorporation of these provisions is to safeguard the sovereignty,
unity, integrity and security of the country, the democratic political system
and the Constitution.
The Constitution envisages three types of emergencies, namely:
(a)  National emergency on the ground of war or external aggression or
armed rebellion16
 (Article 352);
(b)  State emergency (President’s Rule) on the ground of failure of
Constitutional machinery in the states (Article 356) or failure to
comply with the directions of the Centre (Article 365); and
(c)  Financial emergency on the ground of threat to the financial
stability or credit of India (Article 360).
During an emergency, the Central Government becomes all-powerful and
the states go into the total control of the centre. It converts the federal
structure into a unitary one without a formal amendment of the
Constitution. This kind of transformation of the political system from
federal (during normal times) to unitary (during emergency) is a unique
feature of the Indian Constitution.
16. Three-tier Government
Originally, the Indian Constitution, like any other federal Constitution,
provided for a dual polity and contained provisions with regard to the
organisation and powers of the Centre and the states. Later, the 73rd and
74th Constitutional Amendment Acts (1992) have added a third-tier of
Government (i.e., local) which is not found in any other Constitution of the
world.
The 73rd Amendment Act of 1992 gave constitutional recognition to the
panchay-ats (rural local governments) by adding a new Part IX17 and a new
Schedule 11 to the Constitution. Similarly, the 74th Amendment Act of
1992 gave constitutional recognition to the municipalities (urban local
governments) by adding a new Part IX-A18 and a new Schedule 12 to the
Constitution.
17. Co-operative Societies
The 97th Constitutional Amendment Act of 2011 gave a constitutional status
and protection to co-operative societies. In this context, it made the
following three changes in the Constitution:
1.  It made the right to form co-operative societies a fundamental right
(Article 19).
2.  It included a new Directive Principle of State Policy on promotion
of co-operative societies (Article 43-B).
3.  It added a new Part IX-B in the Constitution which is entitled as
“The Co-operative Societies” (Articles 243-ZH to 243-ZT).
The new Part IX-B contains various provisions to ensure that the cooperative societies in the country function in a democratic, professional,
autonomous and economically sound manner. It empowers the Parliament
in respect of multi-state cooperative societies and the state legislatures in
respect of other co-operative societies to make the appropriate law.
CRITICISM OF THE CONSTITUTION
The Constitution of India, as framed and adopted by the Constituent
Assembly of India, has been criticized on the following grounds:
1. A Borrowed Constitution
The critics opined that the Indian Constitution contains nothing new and
original. They described it as a ‘borrowed Constitution’ or a ‘bag of
borrowings’ or a ‘hotch-potch Constitution’ or a ‘patchwork’ of several
documents of the world constitutions. However, this criticism is unfair and
illogical. This is because, the framers of the Constitution made necessary
modifications in the features borrowed from other constitutions for their
suitability to the Indian conditions, at the same time avoiding their faults.
While answering the above criticism in the Constituent Assembly, Dr.
B.R. Ambedkar, the Chairman of the Drafting Committee, said : “One likes
to ask whether there can be anything new in a Constitution framed at this
hour in the history of the world. More than hundred years have rolled over
when the first written Constitution was drafted. It has been followed by
many countries reducing their constitutions to writing. What the scope of a
Constitution should be has long been settled. Similarly, what are the
fundamentals of a Constitution are recognized all over the world. Given
these facts, all Constitutions in their main provisions must look similar. The
only new things, if there can be any, in a Constitution framed so late in the
day are the variations made to remove the faults and to accommodate it to
the needs of the country. The charge of producing a blind copy of the
Constitutions of other countries is based, I am sure, on an inadequate study
of the Constitution”.19
2. A Carbon Copy of the 1935 Act
The critics said that the framers of the Constitution have included a large
number of the provisions of the Government of India Act of 1935 into the
Constitution of India. Hence, they called the Constitution as a “Carbon
Copy of the 1935 Act” or an “Amended Version of the 1935 Act”. For
example, N. Srinivasan observed that the Indian Constitution is “both in
language and substance a close copy of the Act of 1935”. Similarly, Sir Ivor
Jennings, a British Constitutionalist, said that “the Constitution derives
directly from the Government of India Act of 1935 from which, in fact,
many of its provisions are copied almost textually”.
Further, P.R. Deshmukh, a member of the Constituent Assembly,
commented that “the Constitution is essentially the Government of India
Act of 1935 with only adult franchise added”.
The same Dr. B.R. Ambedkar answered the above criticism in the
Constituent Assembly in the following way : “As to the accusation that the
Draft Constitution has reproduced a good part of the provisions of the
Government of India Act, 1935, I make no apologies. There is nothing to be
ashamed of in borrowing. It involves no plagiarism. Nobody holds any
patent rights in the fundamental ideas of a Constitution. What I am sorry
about is that the provisions taken from the Government of India Act, 1935,
relate mostly to the details of administration”.20
3. Un-Indian or Anti-Indian
According to the critics, the Indian Constitution is ‘un-Indian’ or ‘antiIndian’ because it does not reflect the political traditions and the spirit of
India. They said that the foreign nature of the Constitution makes it
unsuitable to the Indian situation or unworkable in India. In this context, K.
Hanumanthaiya, a member of the Constituent Assembly, commented : “We
wanted the music of Veena or Sitar, but here we have the music of an
English band. That was because our Constitution-makers were educated
that way”.21 Similarly, Lokanath Misra, another member of the Constituent
Assembly, criticized the Constitution as a “slavish imitation of the west,
much more - a slavish surrender to the west”.22 Further, Lakshminarayan
Sahu, also a member of the Constituent Assembly, observed: “The ideals on
which this draft Constitution is framed have no manifest relation to the
fundamental spirit of India. This Constitution would not prove suitable and
would break down soon after being brought into operation”.23
4. An Un-Gandhian Constitution
According to the critics, the Indian Constitution is un-Gandhian because it
does not contain the philosophy and ideals of Mahatma Gandhi, the father
of the Indian Nation. They opined that the Constitution should have been
raised and built upon village panchayats and district panchayats. In this
context, the same member of the Constituent Assembly, K. Hanumanthaiya,
said: “That is exactly the kind of Constitution Mahatma Gandhi did not
want and did not envisage”.24 T. Prakasam, another member of the
Constituent Assembly, attributed this lapse to Ambedkar’s non-participation
in the Gandhian movement and the antagonism towards the Gandhian
ideas.25
5. Elephantine Size
The critics stated that the Indian Constitution is too bulky and too detailed
and contains some unnecessary elements. Sir Ivor Jennings, a British
Constitutionalist, observed that the provisions borrowed were not always
well-selected and that the constitution, generally speaking, was too long and
complicated.26
In this context, H.V. Kamath, a member of the Constituent Assembly,
commented : “The emblem and the crest that we have selected for our
assembly is an elephant. It is perhaps in consonance with that our
constitution too is the bulkiest that the world has produced”.27 He also said:
“I am sure, the House does not agree that we should make the Constitution
an elephantine one”.28
6. Paradise of the Lawyers
According to the critics, the Indian Constitution is too legalistic and very
complicated. They opined that the legal language and phraseology adopted
in the constitution makes it a complex document. The same Sir Ivor
Jennings called it a “lawyer’s paradise”.
In this context, H.K. Maheswari, a member of the Constituent Assembly,
observed : “The draft tends to make people more litigious, more inclined to
go to law courts, less truthful and less likely to follow the methods of truth
and non-violence. If I may say so, the draft is really a lawyer’s paradise. It
opens up vast avenues of litigation and will give our able and ingenious
lawyers plenty of work to do”.29
Similarly, P.R. Deshmukh, another member of the Constituent Assembly,
said : “I should, however, like to say that the draft of the articles that have
been brought before the House by Dr. Ambedkar seems to my mind to be
far too ponderous like the ponderous tomes of a law manual. A document
dealing with a constitution hardly uses so much of padding and so much of
verbiage. Perhaps it is difficult for them to compose a document which
should be, to my mind, not a law manual but a socio-political document, a
vibrating, pulsating and life-giving document. But, to our misfortune, that
was not to be, and we have been burdened with so much of words, words
and words which could have been very easily eliminated.”30

4.  Till 2019, the erstwhile State of Jammu and Kashmir had its own
constitution and thus enjoyed a special status by virtue of Article 370
of the Constitution of India. In 2019, this special status was abolished
by a presidential order known as “The Constitution (Application to
Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 2019”. This order superseded the earlier
order known as “The Constitution (Application to Jammu and

the Constitution of India to Jammu and Kashmir also. However, the
inoperative Article 370 continue to remain in the text of the
Constitution of India.

the Constitution of India to Jammu and Kashmir also. However, the
inoperative Article 370 continue to remain in the text of the
Constitution of India.
Further, the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, 2019,
bifurcated the erstwhile State of Jammu and Kashmir into two separate
Union territories, namely, the Union territory of Jammu & Kashmir
and the Union territory of Ladakh.

282. This is because, three entries (87,92 and 130) have been deleted
and one entry is numbered as 257-A.
4 Preamble of the Constitution
The American Constitution was the first to begin with a Preamble. Many
countries, including India, followed this practice. The term ‘Preamble’
refers to the introduction or preface to the Constitution. It contains the
summary or essence of the Constitution. N.A. Palkhivala, an eminent jurist
and constitutional expert, called the Preamble as the ‘identity card of the
Constitution.’
The Preamble to the Indian Constitution is based on the ‘Objectives
Resolution’, drafted and moved by Pandit Nehru, and adopted by the
Constituent Assembly1
. It has been amended by the 42nd Constitutional
Amendment Act (1976), which added three new words–Socialist, Secular
and Integrity.
TEXT OF THE PREAMBLE
The Preamble in its present form reads:
“We, THE PEOPLE OF INDIA, having solemnly resolved to constitute India into a
SOVEREIGN SOCIALIST SECULAR DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC and to secure to all its citizens:
JUSTICE, Social, Economic and Political;
LIBERTY of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship;
EQUALITY of status and of opportunity; and to promote among them all;
FRATERNITY assuring the dignity of the individual and the unity and integrity
of the Nation;
IN OUR CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY this twenty-sixth day of November, 1949, do HEREBY ADOPT,
ENACT AND GIVE TO OURSELVES THIS CONSTITUTION”.
INGREDIENTS OF THE PREAMBLE
The Preamble reveals four ingredients or components:
1.  Source of authority of the Constitution: The Preamble states that the
Constitution derives its authority from the people of India.
2.  Nature of Indian State: It declares India to be of a sovereign,
socialist, secular democratic and republican polity.
3.  Objectives of the Constitution: It specifies justice, liberty, equality
and fraternity as the objectives.
4.  Date of adoption of the Constitution: It stipulates November 26,
1949, as the date.
KEY WORDS IN THE PREAMBLE
Certain key words–Sovereign, Socialist, Secular, Democratic, Republic,
Justice, Liberty, Equality and Fraternity–are explained as follows:
1. Sovereign
The word ‘sovereign’ implies that India is neither a dependency nor a
dominion of any other nation, but an independent state2
. There is no
authority above it, and it is free to conduct its own affairs (both internal and
external).
Though in 1949, India declared the continuation of her full membership
of the Commonwealth of Nations and accepted the British Crown as the
head of the Commonwealth, this extra-constitutional declaration does not
affect India’s sovereignty in any manner3
. Further, India’s membership of
the United Nations Organisation (UNO) also in no way constitutes a
limitation on her sovereignty4
 .
Being a sovereign state, India can either acquire a foreign territory or
cede a part of its territory in favour of a foreign state.
2. Socialist
Even before the term was added by the 42nd Amendment in 1976, the
Constitution had a socialist content in the form of certain Directive
Principles of State Policy. In other words, what was hitherto implicit in the
Constitution has now been made explicit. Moreover, the Congress party
itself adopted a resolution5
to establish a ‘socialistic pattern of society’ in its
Avadi session as early as in 1955 and took measures accordingly.
Notably, the Indian brand of socialism is a ‘democratic socialism’ and
not a ‘communistic socialism’ (also known as ‘state socialism’) which
involves the nationalisation of all means of production and distribution and
the abolition of private property. Democratic socialism, on the other hand,
holds faith in a ‘mixed economy’ where both public and private sectors coexist side by side6
. As the Supreme Court says, ‘Democratic socialism aims
to end poverty, ignorance, disease and inequality of opportunity7
. Indian
socialism is a blend of Marxism and Gandhism, leaning heavily towards the
Gandhian socialism’8
 .
The new Economic Policy (1991) of liberalisation, privatisation and
globalisation has, however, diluted the socialist credentials of the Indian
State.
3. Secular
The term ‘secular’ too was added by the 42nd Constitutional Amendment
Act of 1976. However, as the Supreme Court said in 1974, although the
words ‘secular state’9 were not expressedly mentioned in the Constitution,
there can be no doubt that Constitutionmakers wanted to establish such a
state and accordingly Articles 25 to 28 (guaranteeing the fundamental right
to freedom of religion) have been included in the constitution.
The Indian Constitution embodies the positive concept of secularism ie,
all religions in our country (irrespective of their strength) have the same
status and support from the state10
 .
4. Democratic
A democratic11 polity, as stipulated in the Preamble, is based on the doctrine
of popular sovereignty, that is, possession of supreme power by the people.
Democracy is of two types–direct and indirect. In direct democracy, the
people exercise their supreme power directly as is the case in Switzerland.
There are four devices of direct democracy, namely, Referendum,
Initiative, Recall and Plebiscite12
. In indirect democracy, on the other hand,
the representatives elected by the people exercise the supreme power and
thus carry on the government and make the laws. This type of democracy,
also known as representative democracy, is of two kinds–parliamentary and
presidential.
The Indian Constitution provides for representative parliamentary
democracy under which the executive is responsible to the legislature for all
its policies and actions. Universal adult franchise, periodic elections, rule of
law, independence of judiciary, and absence of discrimination on certain
grounds are the manifestations of the democratic character of the Indian
polity.
The term ‘democratic’ is used in the Preamble in the broader sense
embracing not only political democracy but also social and economic
democracy.
This dimension was stressed by Dr. Ambedkar in his concluding speech
in the Constituent Assembly on November 25, 1949, in the following way:
“Political democracy cannot last unless there lies at the base of it social
democracy. What does social democracy mean ? It means a way of life
which recognises liberty, equality and fraternity. The principles of liberty,
equality and fraternity are not to be treated as separate items in a trinity.
They form a union of trinity in the sense that to divorce one from the other
is to defeat the very purpose of democracy. Liberty cannot be divorced from
equality, equality cannot be divorced from liberty. Nor can liberty and
equality be divorced from fraternity. Without equality, liberty would
produce the supremacy of the few over the many. Equality without liberty,
would kill individual initiative”.12a
In the same context, the Supreme Court observed in 1997 that: “The
Constitution envisions to establish an egalitarian social order rendering to
every citizen social, economic and political justice in a social and economic
democracy of the Bharat Republic”.
5. Republic
A democratic polity can be classified into two categories–monarchy and
republic. In a monarchy, the head of the state (usually king or queen) enjoys
a hereditary position, that is, he comes into office through succession, e.g.,
Britain. In a republic, on the other hand, the head of the state is always
elected directly or indirectly for a fixed period, e.g., USA.
Therefore, the term ‘republic’ in our Preamble indicates that India has an
elected head called the president. He is elected indirectly for a fixed period
of five years.
A republic also means two more things: one, vesting of political
sovereignty in the people and not in a single individual like a king; second,
the absence of any privileged class and hence all public offices being
opened to every citizen without any discrimination.
6. Justice
The term ‘justice’ in the Preamble embraces three distinct forms–social,
economic and political, secured through various provisions of Fundamental
Rights and Directive Principles.
Social justice denotes the equal treatment of all citizens without any
social distinction based on caste, colour, race, religion, sex and so on. It
means absence of privileges being extended to any particular section of the
society, and improvement in the conditions of backward classes (SCs, STs
and OBCs) and women.
Economic justice denotes the non-discrimination between people on the
basis of economic factors. It involves the elimination of glaring inequalities
in wealth, income and property. A combination of social justice and
economic justice denotes what is known as ‘distributive justice’.
Political justice implies that all citizens should have equal political rights,
equal access to all political offices and equal voice in the government.
The ideal of justice–social, economic and political–has been taken from
the Russian Revolution (1917).
7. Liberty
The term ‘liberty’ means the absence of restraints on the activities of
individuals, and at the same time, providing opportunities for the
development of individual personalities.
The Preamble secures to all citizens of India liberty of thought,
expression, belief, faith and worship, through their Fundamental Rights,
enforceable in court of law, in case of violation.
Liberty as elaborated in the Preamble is very essential for the successful
functioning of the Indian democratic system. However, liberty does not
mean ‘license’ to do what one likes, and has to be enjoyed within the
limitations mentioned in the Constitution itself. In brief, the liberty
conceived by the Preamble or Fundamental Rights is not absolute but
qualified.
The ideals of liberty, equality and fraternity in our Preamble have been
taken from the French Revolution (1789–1799).
8. Equality
The term ‘equality’ means the absence of special privileges to any section
of the society, and the provision of adequate opportunities for all
individuals without any discrimination.
The Preamble secures to all citizens of India equality of status and
opportunity. This provision embraces three dimensions of equality–civic,
political and economic.
The following provisions of the chapter on Fundamental Rights ensure
civic equality:
(a)  Equality before the law (Article 14).
(b)  Prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste,
sex or place of birth (Article 15).
(c)  Equality of opportunity in matters of public employment (Article
16).
(d)  Abolition of untouchability (Article 17).
(e)  Abolition of titles (Article 18).
There are two provisions in the Constitution that seek to achieve political
equality. One, no person is to be declared ineligible for inclusion in
electoral rolls on grounds of religion, race, caste or sex (Article 325). Two,
elections to the Lok Sabha and the state assemblies to be on the basis of
adult suffrage (Article 326).
The Directive Principles of State Policy (Article 39) secures to men and
women equal right to an adequate means of livelihood and equal pay for
equal work.
9. Fraternity
Fraternity means a sense of brotherhood. The Constitution promotes this
feeling of fraternity by the system of single citizenship. Also, the
Fundamental Duties (Article 51-A) say that it shall be the duty of every
citizen of India to promote harmony and the spirit of common brotherhood
amongst all the people of India transcending religious, linguistic, regional
or sectional diversities.
The Preamble declares that fraternity has to assure two things–the dignity
of the individual and the unity and integrity of the nation. The word
‘integrity’ has been added to the preamble by the 42nd Constitutional
Amendment (1976).
According to K.M. Munshi, a member of the Drafting Committee of the
Constituent Assembly, the phrase ‘dignity of the individual’ signifies that
the Constitution not only ensures material betterment and maintain a
democratic set-up, but that it also recognises that the personality of every
individual is sacred. This is highlighted through some of the provisions of
the Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles of State Policy, which
ensure the dignity of individuals. Further, the Fundamental Duties (Article
51-A) also protect the dignity of women by stating that it shall be the duty
of every citizen of India to renounce practices derogatory to the dignity of
women, and also makes it the duty of every citizen of India to uphold and
protect the sovereignty, unity and integrity of India.
The phrase ‘unity and integrity of the nation’ embraces both the
psychological and territorial dimensions of national integration. Article 1 of
the Constitution describes India as a ‘Union of States’ to make it clear that
the states have no right to secede from the Union, implying the
indestructible nature of the Indian Union. It aims at overcoming hindrances
to national integration like communalism, regionalism, casteism, linguism,
secessionism and so on.
SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PREAMBLE
The Preamble embodies the basic philosophy and fundamental values–
political, moral and religious–on which the Constitution is based. It
contains the grand and noble vision of the Constituent Assembly, and
reflects the dreams and aspirations of the founding fathers of the
Constitution. In the words of Sir Alladi Krishnaswami Iyer, a member of
the Constituent Assembly who played a significant role in making the
Constitution, ‘The Preamble to our Constitution expresses what we had
thought or dreamt so long’.
According to K.M. Munshi, a member of the Drafting Committee of the
Constituent Assembly, the Preamble is the ‘horoscope of our sovereign
democratic republic’.
Pandit Thakur Das Bhargava, another member of the Constituent
Assembly, summed up the importance of the Preamble in the following
words: ‘The Preamble is the most precious part of the Constitution. It is the
soul of the Constitution. It is a key to the Constitution. It is a jewel set in the
Constitution. It is a proper yardstick with which one can measure the worth
of the Constitution’.
Sir Ernest Barker, a distinguished English political scientist, paid a
glowing tribute to the political wisdom of the authors of the Preamble. He
described the Preamble as the ‘key-note’13
to the Constitution. He was so
moved by the text of the preamble that he quoted14
it at the opening of his
popular book, Principles of Social and Political Theory (1951).
M. Hidayatullah, a former Chief Justice of India, observed, ‘Preamble
resembles the Declaration of Independence of the United States of America,
but is more than a declaration. It is the soul of our Constitution, which lays
down the pattern of our political society. It contains a solemn resolve,
which nothing but a revolution can alter15
 .
PREAMBLE AS PART OF THE CONSTITUTION
One of the controversies about the Preamble is as to whether it is a part of
the Constitution or not.
In the Berubari Union16 case (1960), the Supreme Court said that the
Preamble shows the general purposes behind the several provisions in the
Constitution, and is thus a key to the minds of the makers of the
Constitution. Further, where the terms used in any article are ambiguous or
capable of more than one meaning, some assistance at interpretation may be
taken from the objectives enshrined in the Preamble. Despite this
recognition of the significance of the Preamble, the Supreme Court
specifically opined that Preamble is not a part of the Constitution.
In the Kesavananda Bharati case17
(1973), the Supreme Court rejected
the earlier opinion and held that Preamble is a part of the Constitution. It
observed that the Preamble is of extreme importance and the Constitution
should be read and interpreted in the light of the grand and noble vision
expressed in the Preamble. In the LIC of India case18
(1995) also, the
Supreme Court again held that the Preamble is an integral part of the
Constitution.
Like any other part of the Constitution, the Preamble was also enacted by
the Constituent Assembly; but, after the rest of the Constitution was already
enacted. The reason for inserting the Preamble at the end was to ensure that
it was in conformity with the Constitution as adopted by the Constituent
Assembly. While forwarding the Preamble for votes, the President of the
Constituent Assembly said, ‘The question is that Preamble stands part of
the Constitution’19
. The motion was then adopted. Hence, the current
opinion held by the Supreme Court that the Preamble is a part of the
Constitution, is in consonance with the opinion of the founding fathers of
the Constitution.
However, two things should be noted:
1.  The Preamble is neither a source of power to legislature nor a
prohibition upon the powers of legislature.
2.  It is non-justiciable, that is, its provisions are not enforceable in
courts of law.
AMENABILITY OF THE PREAMBLE
The question as to whether the Preamble can be amended under Article 368
of the Constitution arose for the first time in the historic Kesavananda
Bharati case (1973). It was urged that the Preamble cannot be amended as it
is not a part of the Constitution. The petitioner contended that the amending
power in Article 368 cannot be used to destroy or damage the basic
elements or the fundamental features of the Constitution, which are
enshrined in the Preamble.
The Supreme Court, however, held that the Preamble is a part of the
Constitution. The Court stated that the opinion tendered by it in the
Berubari Union (1960) in this regard was wrong, and held that the
Preamble can be amended, subject to the condition that no amendment is
done to the ‘basic features’. In other words, the Court held that the basic
elements or the fundamental features of the Constitution as contained in the
Preamble cannot be altered by an amendment under Article 36820
 .
The Preamble has been amended only once so far, in 1976, by the 42nd
Constitutional Amendment Act, which has added three new words–
Socialist, Secular and Integrity–to the Preamble. This amendment was held
to be valid.

means commitments. The free association of the sovereign
Commonwealth of Nations does not involve such commitments. Its
very strength lies in its flexibility and its complete freedom. It is wellknown that it is open to any member-nation to go out of the

particular religion as the state religion, as for example, Bangladesh,
Burma, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, and so on.
(c)  Secular State: The state is neutral in the matter of religion and
hence, does not uphold any particular religion as the state religion, as

the State will not have any foundation of religion’. Similarly, P.B.

elements are removed, the structure will not survive and it will not be
the same Constitution or it cannot maintain its identity. An amending
power cannot be interpreted so as to confer power on the Parliament to
take away any of these fundamental and basic characteristics of the
polity’.
5 Union and its Territory
Articles 1 to 4 under Part-I of the Constitution deal with the Union and its
territory.
UNION OF STATES
Article 1 describes India, that is, Bharat as a ‘Union of States’ rather than a
‘Federation of States’. This provision deals with two things: one, name of
the country; and two, type of polity.
There was no unanimity in the Constituent Assembly with regard to the
name of the country. Some members suggested the traditional name
(Bharat), while other advocated the modern name (India). Hence, the
Constituent Assembly had to adopt a mix of both (‘India, that is, Bharat’)
Secondly, the country is described as ‘Union’ although its Constitution is
federal in structure. According to Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, the phrase ‘Union of
States’ has been preferred to ‘Federation of States’ for two reasons: one, the
Indian Federation is not the result of an agreement among the states like the
American Federation; and two, the states have no right to secede from the
federation. The federation is an Union because it is indestructible. The
country is an integral whole and divided into different states only for the
convenience of administration1
 .
According to Article 1, the territory of India can be classified into three
categories:
1.  Territories of the states
2.  Union territories
3.  Territories that may be acquired by the Government of India at any
time.
The names of states and union territories and their territorial extent are
mentioned in the first schedule of the Constitution. At present, there are 28
states and 9 union territories. The provisions of the Constitution pertaining
to the states are applicable to all the states in the same manner2
. However,
the special provisions (under Part XXI) applicable to the States of
Maharashtra, Gujarat, Nagaland, Assam, Manipur, Andhra Pradesh,
Telangana, Sikkim, Mizoram, Arunanchal Pradesh, Goa and Karnataka
override the general provisions relating to the states as a class. Further, the
Fifth and Sixth Schedules contain separate provisions with respect to the
administration of scheduled areas and tribal areas within the states.
Notably, the ‘Territory of India’ is a wider expression than the ‘Union of
India’ because the latter includes only states while the former includes not
only the states, but also union territories and territories that may be acquired
by the Government of India at any future time. The states are the members
of the federal system and share a distribution of powers with the Centre.
The union territories and the acquired territories, on the other hand, are
directly administered by the Central government.
Being a sovereign state, India can acquire foreign territories according to
the modes recognised by international law, i.e., cession (following treaty,
purchase, gift, lease or plebiscite), occupation (hitherto unoccupied by a
recognised ruler), conquest or subjugation. For example, India acquired
several foreign territories such as Dadra and Nagar Haveli; Goa, Daman
and Diu; Puducherry; and Sikkim since the commencement of the
Constitution. The acquisition of these territories are discussed later in this
chapter.
Article 2 empowers the Parliament to ‘admit into the Union of India, or
establish, new states on such terms and conditions as it thinks fit’. Thus,
Article 2 grants two powers to the Parliament: (a) the power to admit into
the Union of India new states; and (b) the power to establish new states.
The first refers to the admission of states which are already in existence,
while the second refers to the establishment of states which were not in
existence before. Notably, Article 2 relates to the admission or
establishment of new states that are not part of the Union of India. Article 3,
on the other hand, relates to the formation of or changes in the existing
states of the Union of India. In other words, Article 3 deals with the internal
re-adjustment inter se of the territories of the constituent states of the Union
of India.
PARLIAMENT’S POWER TO REORGANISE THE
STATES
Article 3 authorises the Parliament to:
(a)  form a new state by separation of territory from any state or by
uniting two or more states or parts of states or by uniting any territory
to a part of any state;
(b)  increase the area of any state;
(c)  diminish the area of any state;
(d)  alter the boundaries of any state; and
(e)  alter the name of any state.
However, Article 3 lays down two conditions in this regard: one, a bill
contemplating the above changes can be introduced in the Parliament only
with the prior recommendation of the President; and two, before
recommending the bill, the President has to refer the same to the state
legislature concerned for expressing its views within a specified period.
Further, the power of Parliament to form new states includes the power to
form a new state or union territory by uniting a part of any state or union
territory to any other state or union territory3
 .
The President (or Parliament) is not bound by the views of the state
legislature and may either accept or reject them, even if the views are
received in time. Further, it is not necessary to make a fresh reference to the
state legislature every time an amendment to the bill is moved and accepted
in Parliament4
. In case of a union territory, no reference need be made to the
concerned legislature to ascertain its views and the Parliament can itself
take any action as it deems fit.
It is, thus, clear that the Constitution authorises the Parliament to form
new states or alter the areas, boundaries or names of the existing states
without their consent. In other words, the Parliament can redraw the
political map of India according to its will. Hence, the territorial integrity or
continued existence of any state is not guaranteed by the Constitution.
Therefore, India is rightly described as ‘an indestructible union of
destructible states’. The Union Government can destroy the states whereas
the state governments cannot destroy the Union. In USA, on the other hand,
the territorial integrity or continued existence of a state is guaranteed by the
Constitution. The American Federal Government cannot form new states or
alter the borders of existing states without the consent of the states
concerned. That is why the USA is described as ‘an indestructible union of
indestructible states.’
Moreover, the Constitution (Article 4) itself declares that laws made for
admission or establishment of new states (under Article 2) and formation of
new states and alteration of areas, boundaries or names of existing states
(under Articles 3) are not to be considered as amendments of the
Constitution under Article 368. This means that such laws can be passed by
a simple majority and by the ordinary legislative process.
Does the power of Parliament to diminish the areas of a state (under
Article 3) include also the power to cede Indian territory to a foreign
country? This question came up for examination before the Supreme Court
in a reference made by the President in 1960. The decision of the Central
Government to cede part of a territory known as Berubari Union (West
Bengal) to Pakistan led to political agitation and controversy and thereby
necessitated the Presidential reference. The Supreme Court held that the
power of Parliament to diminish the area of a state (under Article 3) does
not cover cession of Indian territory to a foreign country. Hence, Indian
territory can be ceded to a foreign state only by amending the Constitution
under Article 368. Consequently, the 9th Constitutional Amendment Act
(1960) was enacted to transfer the said territory to Pakistan.
On the other hand, the Supreme Court in 1969 ruled that, settlement of a
boundary dispute between India and another country does not require a
constitutional amendment. It can be done by executive action as it does not
involve cession of Indian territory to a foreign country.
EXCHANGE OF TERRITORIES WITH BANGLADESH
The 100th Constitutional Amendment Act (2015) was enacted to give effect
to the acquiring of certain territories by India and transfer of certain other
territories to Bangladesh in pursuance of the agreement and its protocol
entered into between the Governments of India and Bangladesh. Under this
deal, India transferred 111 enclaves to Bangladesh, while Bangladesh
transferred 51 enclaves to India. In addition, the deal also involved the
transfer of adverse possessions and the demarcation of a 6.1 km
undemarcated border stretch. For these three purposes, the amendment
modified the provisions relating to the territories of four states (Assam,
West Bengal, Meghalaya and Tripura) in the First Schedule of the
Constitution. The background of this amendment is as follows:
1.  India and Bangladesh have a common land boundary of
approximately 4096.7 kms. The India-East Pakistan land boundary
was determined as per the Radcliffe Award of 1947. Disputes arose out
of some provisions in the Radcliffe Award, which were sought to be
resolved through the Bagge Award of 1950. Another effort was made
to settle these disputes by the Nehru-Noon Agreement of 1958.
However, the issue relating to division of Berubari Union was
challenged before the Supreme Court. To comply with the opinion
rendered by the Supreme Court, the Constitution (9th Amendment)
Act, 1960 was passed by the Parliament. Due to the continuous
litigation and other political developments at that time, the
Constitution (9th Amendment) Act, 1960 could not be notified in
respect of territories in former East Pakistan (presently Bangladesh).4a
2.  On May 16, 1974, the Agreement between India and Bangladesh
concerning the demarcation of the land boundary and related matters
was signed between both the countries to find a solution to the
complex nature of the border demarcation involved. This Agreement
was not ratified as it involved, inter alia, transfer of territory which
requires a Constitutional Amendment. In this connection, it was also
required to identify the precise area on the ground which would be
transferred. Subsequently, the issues relating to demarcation of undemarcated boundary; the territories in adverse possession; and
exchange of enclaves were identified and resolved by signing a
Protocol on September 6, 2011, which forms an integral part of the
Land Boundary Agreement between India and Bangladesh, 1974. The
Protocol was prepared with support and concurrence of the concerned
state governments of Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura and West Bengal.4b
EVOLUTION OF STATES AND UNION TERRITORIES
Integration of Princely States
At the time of independence, India comprised two categories of political
units, namely, the British provinces (under the direct rule of British
government) and the princely states (under the rule of native princes but
subject to the paramountcy of the British Crown). The Indian Independence
Act (1947) created two independent and separate dominions of India and
Pakistan and gave three options to the princely states viz., joining India,
joining Pakistan or remaining independent. Of the 552 princely states
situated within the geographical boundaries of India, 549 joined India and
the remaining 3 (Hyderabad, Junagarh and Kashmir) refused to join India.
However, in course of time, they were also integrated with India–
Hyderabad by means of police action, Junagarh by means of referendum
and Kashmir by the Instrument of Accession.
In 1950, the Constitution contained a four-fold classification of the states
and territories of the Indian Union–Part A, Part B and Part C states and Part
D territories5
. In all, they numbered 29. Part A states comprised nine
erstwhile governor’s provinces of British India. Part B states consisted of
nine erstwhile princely states with legislatures. Part C states consisted of
erstwhile chief commissioner’s provinces of British India and some of the
erstwhile princely states. These Part C states (in all 10 in number) were
centrally administered. The Andaman and Nicobar Islands were kept as the
solitary Part D territories.
Dhar Commission and JVP Committee
The integration of princely states with the rest of India has purely an ad hoc
arrangement. There has been a demand from different regions, particularly
South India, for reorganisation of states on linguistic basis. Accordingly, in
June 1948, the Government of India appointed the Linguistic Provinces
Commission under the chairmanship of S.K. Dhar to examine the feasibility
of this. The commission submitted its report in December, 1948, and
recommended the reorganisation of states on the basis of administrative
convenience rather than linguistic factor. This created much resentment and
led to the appointment of another Linguistic Provinces Committee by the
Congress in December, 1948, itself to examine the whole question afresh. It
consisted of Jawaharlal Nehru, Vallahbhai Patel and Pattabhi Sitaramayya
and hence, was popularly known as JVP Committee6
. It submitted its report
in April, 1949, and formally rejected language as the basis for
reorganisation of states.

However, in October, 1953, the Government of India was forced to create
the first linguistic state, known as Andhra state, by separating the Telugu
speaking areas from the Madras state. This followed a prolonged popular
agitation and the death of Potti Sriramulu, a Congress person of standing,
after a 56-day hunger strike for the cause.
Fazl Ali Commission
The creation of Andhra state intensified the demand from other regions for
creation of states on linguistic basis. This forced the Government of India to
appoint (in December, 1953) a three-member States Reorganisation
Commission under the chairmanship of Fazl Ali to re-examine the whole
question. Its other two members were K.M. Panikkar and H.N. Kunzru. It
submitted its report in September 1955 and broadly accepted language as
the basis of reorganisation of states. But, it rejected the theory of ‘one
language-one state’. Its view was that the unity of India should be regarded
as the primary consideration in any redrawing of the country’s political
units. It identified four major factors that can be taken into account in any
scheme of reorganisation of states:
(a)  Preservation and strengthening of the unity and security of the
country.
(b)  Linguistic and cultural homogeneity.
(c)  Financial, economic and administrative considerations.
(d)  Planning and promotion of the welfare of the people in each state
as well as of the nation as a whole.

The commission suggested the abolition of the four-fold classification of
states and territories under the original Constitution and creation of 16
states and 3 centrally administered territories. The Government of India
accepted these recommendations with certain minor modifications. By the
States Reorganisation Act (1956) and the 7th Constitutional Amendment
Act (1956), the distinction between Part A and Part B states was done away
with and Part C states were abolished. Some of them were merged with
adjacent states and some other were designated as union territories. As a
result, 14 states and 6 union territories were created on November 1, 1956.7
The States Reorganisation Act (1956) established the new state of Kerala
by merging the Travancore - Cochin State with the Malabar District of
Madras state and Kasargode of South Canara (Dakshina Kannada). It
merged the Telugu-speaking areas of Hyderabad state with the Andhra state
to create the Andhra Pradesh state. Further, it merged the Madya Bharat
state, Vindya Pradesh state and Bhopal state into the Madya Pradesh state.
Similarly, it merged the Saurashtra state and Kutch state into that of the
Bombay state, the Coorg state into that of Mysore state; the Patiala and East
Punjab States Union (Pepsu) into that of Punjab state; and the Ajmer state
into that of Rajastan state. Moreover, it created the new union territory of
Laccadive, Minicoy and Amindivi Islands from the territory detached from
the Madras state.
New States and Union Territories Created After 1956
Even after the large-scale reorganisation of the states in 1956, the political
map of India underwent continuous changes due to the pressure of popular
agitations and political conditions. The demand for the creation of some
more states on the basis of language or cultural homogeneity resulted in the
bifurcation of existing states.
Maharashtra and Gujarat
In 1960, the bilingual state of Bombay was divided8
into two separate
states–Maharashtra for Marathispeaking people and Gujarat for
Gujaratispeaking people. Gujarat was established as the 15th state of the
Indian Union.
Dadra and Nagar Haveli
The Portuguese ruled this territory until its liberation in 1954. Subsequently,
the administration was carried on till 1961 by an administrator chosen by
the people themselves. It was converted into a union territory of India by
the 10th Constitutional Amendment Act, 1961.
Goa, Daman and Diu
India acquired these three territories from the Portuguese by means of a
police action in 1961. They were constituted as a union territory by the 12th
Constitutional Amendment Act, 1962. Later, in 1987, Goa was conferred a
statehood.9 Consequently, Daman and Diu was made a separate union
territory.
Puducherry
The territory of Puducherry comprises the former French establishments in
India known as Puducherry, Karaikal, Mahe and Yanam. The French
handed over this territory to India in 1954. Subsequently, it was
administered as an ‘acquired territory’, till 1962 when it was made a union
territory by the 14th Constitutional Amendment Act.
Nagaland
In 1963, the State of Nagaland was formed10 by taking the Naga Hills and
Tuensang area out of the state of Assam. This was done to satisfy the
movement of the hostile Nagas. However, before giving Nagaland the status
of the 16th state of the Indian Union, it was placed under the control of
governor of Assam in 1961.
Haryana, Chandigarh and Himachal Pradesh
In 1966, the State of Punjab was bifurcated11
to create Haryana, the 17th
state of the Indian Union, and the union territory of Chandigarh. This
followed the demand for a separate ‘Sikh Homeland’ (Punjabi Subha)
raised by the Akali Dal under the leadership of Master Tara Singh. On the
recommendation of the Shah Commission (1966), the Punjabi-speaking
areas were constituted into the unilingual state of Punjab, the Hindispeaking areas were constituted into the State of Haryana and the hill areas
were merged with the adjoining union territory of Himachal Pradesh. In
1971, the union territory of Himachal Pradesh was elevated12
to the status of
a state (18th state of the Indian Union).
Manipur, Tripura and Meghalaya
In 1972, the political map of Northeast India underwent a major change.13
Thus, the two union territories of Manipur and Tripura and the sub-state of
Meghalaya got statehood and the two union territories of Mizoram and
Arunachal Pradesh (originally known as North-East Frontier Agency–
NEFA) came into being. With this, the number of states of the Indian Union
increased to 21 (Manipur 19th, Tripura 20th and Meghalaya 21st). Initially,
the 22nd Constitutional Amendment Act (1969) created Meghalaya as an
‘autonomous state’ or ‘sub-state’ within the state of Assam with its own
legislature and council of ministers. However, this did not satisfy the
aspirations of the people of Meghalaya. The union territories of Mizoram
and Arunachal Pradesh were also formed out of the territories of Assam.
Sikkim
Till 1947, Sikkim was an Indian princely state ruled by Chogyal. In 1947,
after the lapse of British paramountcy, Sikkim became a ‘protectorate’ of
India, whereby the Indian Government assumed responsibility for the
defence, external affairs and communications of Sikkim. In 1974, Sikkim
expressed its desire for greater association with India. Accordingly, the 35th
Constitutional Amendment Act (1974) was enacted by the parliament. This
amendment introduced a new class of statehood under the constitution by
conferring on Sikkim the status of an ‘associate state’ of the Indian Union.
For this purpose, a new Article 2-A and a new schedule (10th Schedule
containing the terms and conditions of association) were inserted in the
Constitution. This experiment, however, did not last long as it could not
fully satisfy the aspirations of the people of Sikkim. In a referendum held in
1975, they voted for the abolition of the institution of Chogyal and Sikkim
becoming an integral part of India. Consequently, the 36th Constitutional
Amendment Act (1975) was enacted to make Sikkim a full-fledged state of
the Indian Union (the 22nd state). This amendment amended the First and
the Fourth Schedules to the Constitution and added a new Article 371-F to
provide for certain special provisions with respect to the administration of
Sikkim. It also repealed Article 2-A and the 10th Schedule that were added
by the 35th Amendment Act of 1974.
Mizoram, Arunachal Pradesh and Goa
In 1987, three new States of Mizoram,14 Arunachal Pradesh15 and Goa16
came into being as the 23rd, 24th and 25th states of the Indian Union
respectively. The union territory of Mizoram was conferred the status of a
full state as a sequel to the signing of a memorandum of settlement
(Mizoram Peace Accord) in 1986 between the Central government and the
Mizo National Front, ending the two-decade-old insurgency. Arunachal
Pradesh had also been a union territory from 1972. The State of Goa was
created by separating the territory of Goa from the Union Territory of Goa,
Daman and Diu.
Chhattisgarh, Uttarakhand and Jharkhand
In 2000, three more new States of Chhattisgarh,17 Uttarakhand18 and
Jharkhand19 were created out of the territories of Madhya Pradesh, Uttar
Pradesh and Bihar, respectively. These became the 26th, 27th and 28th
states of the Indian Union, respectively.
Telangana
In 2014, the new state of Telangana came into existence as the 29th state of
the Indian Union. It was carved out of the territories of Andhra Pradesh.
The Andhra State Act (1953) formed the first linguistic state of India,
known as the state of Andhra, by taking out the Telugu speaking areas from
the State of Madras (now Tamil Nadu). Kurnool was the capital of Andhra
state and the state high court was established at Guntur.
The States Reorganisation Act (1956) merged the Telugu-speaking areas
of Hyderabad state with the Andhra state to create the enlarged Andhra
Pradesh state. The capital of the state was shifted to Hyderabad.
Again, the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act (2014) bifurcated the
Andhra Pradesh into two separate states, namely, the Andhra Pradesh
(residuary) and the Telangana.
Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh
Till 2019, the erstwhile State of Jammu and Kashmir had its own
constitution and thus enjoyed a special status by virtue of Article 370 of the
Constitution of India. In 2019, this special status was abolished by a
presidential order known as “The Constitution (Application to Jammu and
Kashmir) Order, 2019”. This order superseded the earlier order known as
“The Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1954”. The
2019 order extended all the provisions of the Constitution of India to
Jammu and Kashmir also. However, the inoperative Article 370 continue to
remain in the text of the Constitution of India.
Further, the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, 2019, bifurcated
the erstwhile State of Jammu and Kashmir into two separate union
territories, namely, the union territory of Jammu & Kashmir and the union
territory of Ladakh.
The union territory of Jammu and Kashmir comprises all the districts of
the erstwhile State of Jammu and Kashmir except the Kargil and Leh
districts which have gone to the union territory of Ladakh.
Thus, the number of states and union territories increased from 14 and 6
in 1956 to 28 and 9 in 2019, respectively20
 .
Change of Names
The names of some states and union territories have also been changed. The
United Provinces was the first state to have a new name. It was renamed
‘Uttar Pradesh’ in 1950. In 1969, Madras was renamed21
‘Tamil Nadu’.
Similarly, in 1973, Mysore was renamed22
‘Karnataka’. In the same year,
Laccadive, Minicoy and Amindivi Islands were renamed23
‘Lakshadweep’.
In 1992, the Union Territory of Delhi was redesignated as the National
Capital Territory of Delhi (without being conferred the status of a fullfledged state) by the 69th Constitutional Amendment Act, 1991.24
In 2006,
Uttaranchal was renamed25 as ‘Uttarakhand’. In the same year, Pondicherry
was renamed26
 as ‘Puducherry’. In 2011, Orissa was renamed27
 as ‘Odisha’.

6 Citizenship
MEANING AND SIGNIFICANCE
Like any other modern state, India has two kinds of people–citizens and
aliens. Citizens are full members of the Indian State and owe allegiance to
it. They enjoy all civil and political rights. Aliens, on the other hand, are the
citizens of some other state and hence, do not enjoy all the civil and
political rights. They are of two categories–friendly aliens or enemy aliens.
Friendly aliens are the subjects of those countries that have cordial relations
with India. Enemy aliens, on the other hand, are the subjects of that country
that is at war with India. They enjoy lesser rights than the friendly aliens,
eg, they do not enjoy protection against arrest and detention (Article 22).
The Constitution confers the following rights and privileges on the
citizens of India (and denies the same to aliens):
1.  Right against discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex
or place of birth (Article 15).
2.  Right to equality of opportunity in the matter of public employment
(Article 16).
3.  Right to freedom of speech and expression, assembly, association,
movement, residence and profession (Article 19).
4.  Cultural and educational rights (Articles 29 and 30).
5.  Right to vote in elections to the Lok Sabha and state legislative
assembly.
6.  Right to contest for the membership of the Parliament and the state
legislature.
7.  Eligibility to hold certain public offices, that is, President of India,
Vice-President of India, judges of the Supreme Court and the high
courts, Governor of states, Attorney General of India and Advocate
General of states.
Along with the above rights, the citizens also owe certain duties towards
the Indian State, as for example, paying taxes, respecting the national flag
and national anthem, defending the country and so on.
In India both a citizen by birth as well as a naturalised citizen are eligible
for the office of President while in USA, only a citizen by birth and not a
naturalised citizen is eligible for the office of President.
CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS
The Constitution deals with the citizenship from Articles 5 to 11 under Part
II. However, it contains neither any permanent nor any elaborate provisions
in this regard. It only identifies the persons who became citizens of India at
its commencement (i.e., on January 26, 1950). It does not deal with the
problem of acquisition or loss of citizenship subsequent to its
commencement. It empowers the Parliament to enact a law to provide for
such matters and any other matter relating to citizenship. Accordingly, the
Parliament has enacted the Citizenship Act (1955), which has been
amended from time to time.
According to the Constitution, the following four categories of persons
became the citizens of India at its commencement i.e., on January 26, 1950:
1.  A person who had his domicile in India and also fulfilled any one
of the three conditions, viz., if he was born in India; or if either of his
parents was born in India; or if he has been ordinarily resident in India
for five years immediately before the commencement of the
Constitution, became a citizen of India.
2.  A person who migrated to India from Pakistan became an Indian
citizen if he or either of his parents or any of his grandparents was
born in undivided India and also fulfilled any one of the two
conditions viz., in case he migrated to India before July 19, 19481
, he
had been ordinarily resident in India since the date of his migration; or
in case he migrated to India on or after July 19, 1948, he had been
registered as a citizen of India. But, a person could be so registered
only if he had been resident in India for six months preceding the date
of his application for registration.
3.  A person who migrated to Pakistan from India after March 1, 1947,
but later returned to India for resettlement could become an Indian
citizen. For this, he had to be resident in India for six months
preceding the date of his application for registration2
 .
4.  A person who, or any of whose parents or grandparents, was born
in undivided India but who is ordinarily residing outside India shall
become an Indian citizen if he has been registered as a citizen of India
by the diplomatic or consular representative of India in the country of
his residence, whether before or after the commencement of the
Constitution. Thus, this provision covers the overseas Indians who
may want to acquire Indian citizenship.
To sum up, these provisions deal with the citizenship of (a) persons
domiciled in India; (b) persons migrated from Pakistan; (c) persons
migrated to Pakistan but later returned; and (d) persons of Indian origin
residing outside India.
The other constitutional provisions with respect to the citizenship are as
follows:
1.  No person shall be a citizen of India or be deemed to be a citizen of
India, if he has voluntarily acquired the citizenship of any foreign
state.
2.  Every person who is or is deemed to be a citizen of India shall
continue to be such citizen, subject to the provisions of any law made
by Parliament.
3.  Parliament shall have the power to make any provision with respect
to the acquisition and termination of citizenship and all other matters
relating to citizenship.
CITIZENSHIP ACT, 1955
The Citizenship Act (1955) provides for acquisition and loss of citizenship
after the commencement of the Constitution.
Originally, the Citizenship Act (1955) also provided for the
Commonwealth Citizenship. But, this provision was repealed by the
Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2003.
Acquisition of Citizenship
The Citizenship Act of 1955 prescribes five ways of acquiring citizenship,
viz, birth, descent, registration, naturalisation and incorporation of territory:
1. By Birth
A person born in India on or after January 26, 1950 but before July 1, 1987
is a citizen of India by birth irrespective of the nationality of his parents.
A person born in India on or after July 1, 1987 is considered as a citizen
of India only if either of his parents is a citizen of India at the time of his
birth.
Further, those born in India on or after December 3, 2004 are considered
citizens of India only if both of their parents are citizens of India or one of
whose parents is a citizen of India and the other is not an illegal migrant at
the time of their birth.
The children of foreign diplomats posted in India and enemy aliens
cannot acquire Indian citizenship by birth.
2. By Descent
A person born outside India on or after January 26, 1950 but before
December 10, 1992 is a citizen of India by descent, if his father was a
citizen of India at the time of his birth.
A person born outside India on or after December 10, 1992 is considered
as a citizen of India if either of his parents is a citizen of India at the time of
his birth.
December 3, 2004 onwards, a person born outside India shall not be a
citizen of India by descent, unless his birth is registered at an Indian
consulate within one year of the date of birth or with the permission of the
Central Government, after the expiry of the said period. An application, for
registration of the birth of a minor child, to an Indian consulate shall be
accompanied by an undertaking in writing from the parents of such minor
child that he or she does not hold the passport of another country.
Further, a minor who is a citizen of India by virtue of descent and is also
a citizen of any other country shall cease to be a citizen of India if he does
not renounce the citizenship or nationality of another country within six
months of his attaining full age.
3. By Registration
The Central Government may, on an application, register as a citizen of
India any person (not being an illegal migrant) if he belongs to any of the
following categories, namely:-
(a)  a person of Indian origin who is ordinarily resident in India for
seven years before making an application for registration;
(b)  a person of Indian origin who is ordinarily resident in any country
or place outside undivided India;
(c)  a person who is married to a citizen of India and is ordinarily
resident in India for seven years before making an application for
registration;
(d)  minor children of persons who are citizens of India;
(e)  a person of full age and capacity whose parents are registered as
citizens of India;
(f)  a person of full age and capacity who, or either of his parents, was
earlier citizen of independent India, and is ordinarily resident in India
for twelve months immediately before making an application for
registration;
(g)  a person of full age and capacity who has been registered as an
overseas citizen of India cardholder for five years, and who is
ordinarily resident in India for twelve months before making an
application for registration.
A person shall be deemed to be of Indian origin if he, or either of his
parents, was born in undivided India or in such other territory which
became part of India after the August 15, 1947.
All the above categories of persons must take an oath of allegiance
before they are registered as citizens of India2a
.
4. By Naturalisation
The Central Government may, on an application, grant a certificate of
naturalisation to any person (not being an illegal migrant) if he possesses
the following qualifications:
(a)  that he is not a subject or citizen of any country where citizens of
India are prevented from becoming subjects or citizens of that country
by naturalisation;
(b)  that, if he is a citizen of any country, he undertakes to renounce the
citizenship of that country in the event of his application for Indian
citizenship being accepted;
(c)  that he has either resided in India or been in the service of a
Government in India or partly the one and partly the other, throughout
the period of twelve months immediately preceding the date of the
application;
(d)  that during the fourteen years immediately preceding the said
period of twelve months, he has either resided in India or been in the
service of a Government in India, or partly the one and partly the other,
for periods amounting in the aggregate to not less than eleven years;
(e)  that he is of good character;
(f)  that he has an adequate knowledge of a language specified in the
Eighth Schedule to the Constitution3
 ; and
(g)  that in the event of a certificate of naturalisation being granted to
him, he intends to reside in India, or to enter into or continue in,
service under a Government in India or under an international
organisation of which India is a member or under a society, company
or body of persons established in India. However, the Government of
India may waive all or any of the above conditions for naturalisation in
the case of a person who has rendered distinguished service to the
science, philosophy, art, literature, world peace or human progress.
Every naturalised citizen must take an oath of allegiance to the
Constitution of India.
5. By Incorporation of Territory
If any foreign territory becomes a part of India, the Government of India
specifies the persons who among the people of the territory shall be the
citizens of India. Such persons become the citizens of India from the
notified date. For example, when Pondicherry became a part of India, the
Government of India issued the Citizenship (Pondicherry) Order (1962),
under the Citizenship Act (1955).
6. Special Provisions as to Citizenship of Persons Covered by the Assam
Accord
The Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 1985, added the following special
provisions as to citizenship of persons covered by the Assam Accord
(which related to the foreigners’ issue):
(a)  All persons of Indian origin who came to Assam before the
January 1, 1966 from Bangladesh and who have been ordinarily
residents in Assam since the date of their entry into Assam shall be
deemed to be citizens of India as from the January 1, 1966.
(b)  Every person of Indian origin who came to Assam on or after the
January 1, 1966 but before the March 25, 1971 from Bangladesh and
who has been ordinarily resident in Assam since the date of his entry
into Assam and who has been detected to be a foreigner shall register
himself. Such a registered person shall be deemed to be a citizen of
India for all purposes as from the date of expiry of a period of ten
years from the date of detection as a foreigner. But, in the intervening
period of ten years, he shall have the same rights and obligations as a
citizen of India, excepting the right to vote.
Loss of Citizenship
The Citizenship Act (1955) prescribes three ways of losing citizenship
whether acquired under the Act or prior to it under the Constitution, viz,
renunciation, termination and deprivation:
1. By Renunciation
Any citizen of India of full age and capacity can make a declaration
renouncing his Indian citizenship. Upon the registration of that declaration,
that person ceases to be a citizen of India. However, if such a declaration is
made during a war in which India is engaged, its registration shall be
withheld by the Central Government.
Further, when a person renounces his Indian citizenship, every minor
child of that person also loses Indian citizenship. However, when such a
child attains the age of eighteen, he may resume Indian citizenship.
2. By Termination
When an Indian citizen voluntarily (consciously, knowingly and without
duress, undue influence or compulsion) acquires the citizenship of another
country, his Indian citizenship automatically terminates. This provision,
however, does not apply during a war in which India is engaged.
3. By Deprivation
It is a compulsory termination of Indian citizenship by the Central
government, if:
(a)  the citizen has obtained the citizenship by fraud:
(b)  the citizen has shown disloyalty to the Constitution of India:
(c)  the citizen has unlawfully traded or communicated with the enemy
during a war;
(d)  the citizen has, within five years after registration or naturalisation,
been imprisoned in any country for two years; and
(e)  the citizen has been ordinarily resident out of India for seven years
continuously.
4
SINGLE CITIZENSHIP
Though the Indian Constitution is federal and envisages a dual polity
(Centre and states), it provides for only a single citizenship, that is, the
Indian citizenship. The citizens in India owe allegiance only to the Union.
There is no separate state citizenship. The other federal states like USA and
Switzerland, on the other hand, adopted the system of double citizenship.
In USA, each person is not only a citizen of USA but also of the
particular state to which he belongs. Thus, he owes allegiance to both and
enjoys dual sets of rights–one set conferred by the national government and
another by the state government. This system creates the problem of
discrimination, that is, a state may discriminate in favour of its citizens in
matters like right to vote, right to hold public offices, right to practice
professions and so on. This problem is avoided in the system of single
citizenship prevalent in India.
In India, all citizens irrespective of the state in which they are born or
reside enjoy the same political and civil rights of citizenship all over the
country and no discrimination is made between them. However, this general
rule of absence of discrimination is subject to some exceptions, viz,
1.  The Parliament (under Article 16) can prescribe residence within a
state or union territory as a condition for certain employments or
appointments in that state or union territory, or local authority or other
authority within that state or union territory. Accordingly, the
Parliament enacted the Public Employment (Requirement as to
Residence) Act, 1957, and thereby authorised the Government of India
to prescribe residential qualification only for appointment to nonGazetted posts in Andhra Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Manipur and
Tripura. As this Act expired in 1974, there is no such provision for any
state except Andhra Pradesh5
 and Telangana5a
.
2.  The Constitution (under Article 15) prohibits discrimination against
any citizen on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth and
not on the ground of residence. This means that the state can provide
special benefits or give preference to its residents in matters that do not
come within the purview of the rights given by the Constitution to the
Indian citizens. For example, a state may offer concession in fees for
education to its residents.
3.  The freedom of movement and residence (under Article 19) is
subjected to the protection of interests of any schedule tribe. In other
words, the right of outsiders to enter, reside and settle in tribal areas is
restricted. Of course, this is done to protect the distinctive culture,
language, customs and manners of schedule tribes and to safeguard
their traditional vocation and property against exploitation.
4.  Till 2019, the legislature of the erstwhile state of Jammu and
Kashmir was empowered to:
(a)  define the persons who are permanent residents of the state; and
(b)  confer any special rights and privileges on such permanent
residents as respects:
(i) employment under the state government;
(ii) acquisition of immovable property in the state;
(iii) settlement in the state; and
(iv) right to scholarships and such other forms of aid
provided by the state government.
The above provision was based on Article 35-A of the Constitution of
India. This Article was inserted in the constitution by “The Constitution
(Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1954”. This order was issued
by the President under Article 370 of the Constitution which had provided a
special status to the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir. In 2019, this
special status was abolished by a new presidential order known as “The
Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 2019”. This order
superseded the earlier 1954 order.
The Constitution of India, like that of Canada, has introduced the system
of single citizenship and provided uniform rights (except in few cases) for
the people of India to promote the feeling of fraternity and unity among
them and to build an integrated Indian nation. Despite this, India has been
witnessing the communal riots, class conflicts, caste wars, linguistic clashes
and ethnic disputes. Thus, the cherished goal of the founding fathers and the
Constitution-makers to build an united and integrated Indian nation has not
been fully realised.
OVERSEAS CITIZENSHIP OF INDIA
In September 2000, the Government of India (Ministry of External Affairs) had set-up a
High Level Committee on the Indian Diaspora under the Chairmanship of L.M.
Singhvi. The mandate of the Committee was to make a comprehensive study of the
global Indian Diaspora and to recommend measures for a constructive relationship with
them.
The committee submitted its report in January, 2002. It recommended the amendment
of the Citizenship Act (1955) to provide for grant of dual citizenship to the Persons of
Indian Origin (PIOs) belonging to certain specified countries.
Accordingly, the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2003, made provision for acquisition
of Overseas Citizenship of India (OCI) by the PIOs of 16 specified countries other than
Pakistan and Bangladesh. It also omitted all provisions recognizing, or relating to the
Commonwealth Citizenship from the Principal Act.
Later, the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2005, expanded the scope of grant of OCI
for PIOs of all countries except Pakistan and Bangladesh as long as their home
countries all dual citizenship under their local laws. It must be noted here that the OCI
is not actually a dual citizenships as the Indian Constitution forbids dual citizenship or
dual nationality (Article 9).
Again, the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2015, has modified the provisions
pertaining to the OCI in the Principal Act. It has introduced a new scheme called
“Overseas Citizen of India Cardholder” by merging the PIO card scheme and the OCI
card scheme.
The PIO card scheme was introduced on August 19, 2002 and thereafter the OCI card
scheme was introduced w.e.f. December 2, 2005. Both the schemes were running in
parallel even though the OCI card scheme had become more popular. This was causing
unnecessary confusion in the minds of applicants. Keeping in view some problems
being faced by applicants and to provide enhanced facilities to them, the Government of
India decided to formulate one single scheme after merging the PIO and OCI schemes,
containing positive attributes of both. Hence, for achieving this objective, the
Citizenship (Amendment)
Act, 2015, was enacted. The PIO scheme was rescinded w.e.f. January 9, 2015 and it
was also notified that all existing PIO cardholders shall be deemed to be OCI
cardholders w.e.f. January 9, 2015.7
The Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2015, replaced the nomenclature of “Overseas
Citizen of India” with that of “Overseas Citizen of India Cardholder” and made the
following provisions in the Principal Act :
I. Registration of Overseas Citizen of India Cardholder
(1)  The Central Government may, on an application made in this behalf, register
as an overseas citizen of India cardholder–
(a)  any person of full age and capacity,–
(i) who is a citizen of another country, but was a citizen of India
at the time of, or at any time after the commencement of the
Constitution; or
(ii) who is a citizen of another country, but was eligible to become
a citizen of India at the time of the commencement of the
Constitution; or
(iii) who is a citizen of another country, but belonged to a territory
that became part of India after the 15th August, 1947; or
(iv) who is a child or a grandchild or a great grandchild of such a
citizen; or
(b)  a person, who is a minor child of a person mentioned in clause (a); or
(c)  a person, who is a minor child, and whose both parents are citizens of India or
one of the parents is a citizen of India; or
(d)  spouse of foreign origin of a citizen of India or spouse of foreign origin of an
Overseas Citizen of India Cardholder and whose marriage has been registered and
subsisted for a continuous period of not less than two years immediately preceding
the presentation of the application.
No person, who or either of whose parents or grandparents or great grandparents is
or had been a citizen of Pakistan, Bangladesh or such other country as the Central
Government may, specify, shall be eligible for registration as an Overseas Citizen
of India Cardholder.
(2)  The Central Government may specify the date from which the existing persons
of Indian origin cardholders shall be deemed to be overseas citizens of India
cardholders.
(3)  Notwithstanding anything contained in point (1), the Central Government may,
if it is satisfied that special circumstances exist, after recording the circumstances
in writing, register a person as an Overseas Citizen of India Cardholder.
II. Conferment of Rights on Overseas Citizen of India Cardholder
(1)  An overseas citizen of India cardholder shall be entitled to such rights, as the
Central Government may specify in this behalf.
(2)  An overseas citizen of India cardholder shall not be entitled to the following
rights (which are conferred on a citizen of India)–
(a)  He shall not be entitled to the right to equality of opportunity in matters of
public employment.
(b)  He shall not be eligible for election as President.
(c)  He shall not be eligible for election as Vice-President.
(d)  He shall not be eligible for appointment as a Judge of the Supreme Court.
(e)  He shall not be eligible for appointment as a Judge of the High Court.
(f)  He shall not be entitled for registration as a voter.
(g)  He shall not be eligible for being a member of the House of the People or of
the Council of States.
(h)  He shall not be eligible for being a member of the State Legislative Assembly
or the State Legislative Council.
(i)  He shall not be eligible for appointment to public services and posts in
connection with affairs of the Union or of any State except for appointment in such
services and posts as the Central Government may specify.
III. Renunciation of Overseas Citizen of India Card
(1)  If any overseas citizen of India cardholder makes in prescribed manner a
declaration renouncing the card registering him as an overseas citizen of India
cardholder, the declaration shall be registered by the Central Government, and
upon such registration, that person shall cease to be an overseas citizen of India
cardholder.
(2)  Where a person ceases to be an overseas citizen of India cardholder, the spouse
of foreign origin of that person, who has obtained overseas citizen of India card
and every minor child of that person registered as an overseas citizen of India
cardholder shall thereupon cease to be an overseas citizen of India cardholder.
IV. Cancellation of Registration as Overseas Citizen of India Cardholder
The Central Government may cancel the registration of a person as an overseas citizen
of India cardholder, if it is satisfied that–
(a)  the registration as an overseas citizen of India cardholder was obtained by
means of fraud, false representation or the concealment of any material fact; or
(b)  the overseas citizen of India cardholder has shown disaffection towards the
Constitution of India; or
(c)  the overseas citizen of India cardholder has, during any war in which India
may be engaged, unlawfully traded or communicated with an enemy; or
(d)  the overseas citizen of India cardholder has, within five years after
registration, been sentenced to imprisonment for a term of not less than two years;
or
(e)  it is necessary so to do in the interests of the sovereignty and integrity of India,
the security of India, friendly relations of India with any foreign country, or in the
interests of the general public; or
(f)  the marriage of an overseas citizen of India cardholder–
(i) has been dissolved by a competent court of law or otherwise; or
(ii) has not been dissolved but, during the subsistence of such marriage, he
has solemnised marriage with any other person.

7 Fundamental Rights
The Fundamental Rights are enshrined in Part III of the Constitution from
Articles 12 to 35. In this regard, the framers of the Constitution derived
inspiration from the Constitution of USA (i.e., Bill of Rights).
Part III of the Constitution is rightly described as the Magna Carta of
India.1
It contains a very long and comprehensive list of ‘justiciable’
Fundamental Rights. In fact, the Fundamental Rights in our Constitution are
more elaborate than those found in the Constitution of any other country in
the world, including the USA.
The Fundamental Rights are guaranteed by the Constitution to all persons
without any discrimination. They uphold the equality of all individuals, the
dignity of the individual, the larger public interest and unity of the nation.
The Fundamental Rights are meant for promoting the ideal of political
democracy. They prevent the establishment of an authoritarian and despotic
rule in the country, and protect the liberties and freedoms of the people
against the invasion by the State. They operate as limitations on the tyranny
of the executive and arbitrary laws of the legislature. In short, they aim at
establishing ‘a government of laws and not of men’.
The Fundamental Rights are named so because they are guaranteed and
protected by the Constitution, which is the fundamental law of the land.
They are ‘fundamental’ also in the sense that they are most essential for the
all-round development (material, intellectual, moral and spiritual) of the
individuals.
Originally, the Constitution provided for seven Fundamental Rights viz,
1.  Right to equality (Articles 14–18)
2.  Right to freedom (Articles 19–22)
3.  Right against exploitation (Articles 23–24)
4.  Right to freedom of religion (Articles 25–28)
5.  Cultural and educational rights (Articles 29–30)
6.  Right to property (Article 31)
7.  Right to constitutional remedies (Article 32)
However, the right to property was deleted from the list of Fundamental
Rights by the 44th Amendment Act, 1978. It is made a legal right under
Article 300-A in Part XII of the Constitution. So at present, there are only
six Fundamental Rights.
FEATURES OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS
The Fundamental Rights guaranteed by the Constitution are characterised
by the following:
1.  Some of them are available only to the citizens while others are
available to all persons whether citizens, foreigners or legal persons
like corporations or companies.
2.  They are not absolute but qualified. The state can impose
reasonable restrictions on them. However, whether such restrictions
are reasonable or not is to be decided by the courts. Thus, they strike a
balance between the rights of the individual and those of the society as
a whole, between individual liberty and social control.
3.  All of them are available against the arbitrary action of the state.
However, some of them are also available against the action of private
individuals.
4.  Some of them are negative in character, that is, place limitations on
the authority of the State, while others are positive in nature,
conferring certain privileges on the persons.
5.  They are justiciable, allowing persons to move the courts for their
enforcement, if and when they are violated.
6.  They are defended and guaranteed by the Supreme Court. Hence,
the aggrieved person can directly go to the Supreme Court, not
necessarily by way of appeal against the judgement of the high courts.
7.  They are not sacrosanct or permanent. The Parliament can curtail or
repeal them but only by a constitutional amendment act and not by an
ordinary act. Moreover, this can be done without affecting the ‘basic
structure’ of the Constitution. (The amenability of fundamental rights
is explained in detail in Chapter 11).
8.  They can be suspended during the operation of a National
Emergency except the rights guaranteed by Articles 20 and 21.
Further, the six rights guaranteed by Article 19 can be suspended only
when emergency is declared on the grounds of war or external
aggression (i.e., external emergency) and not on the ground of armed
rebellion (i.e., internal emergency). (The suspension of fundamental
rights during a national Emergency is explained in detail in Chapter
16).
9.  Their scope of operation is limited by Article 31A (saving of laws
providing for acquisition of estates, etc.), Article 31B (validation of
certain acts and regulations included in the 9th Schedule) and Article
31C (saving of laws giving effect to certain directive principles).
10.  Their application to the members of armed forces, para-military
forces, police forces, intelligence agencies and analogous services can
be restricted or abrogated by the Parliament (Article 33).
11.  Their application can be restricted while martial law is in force in
any area. Martial law means ‘military rule’ imposed under abnormal
circumstances to restore order (Article 34). It is different from the
imposition of national emergency.
12.  Most of them are directly enforceable (self-executory) while a few
of them can be enforced on the basis of a law made for giving effect to
them. Such a law can be made only by the Parliament and not by state
legislatures so that uniformity throughout the country is maintained
(Article 35).
DEFINITION OF STATE
The term ‘State’ has been used in different provisions concerning the
fundamental rights. Hence, Article 12 has defined the term for the purposes
of Part III. According to it, the State includes the following:
(a)  Government and Parliament of India, that is, executive and
legislative organs of the Union government.
(b)  Government and legislature of states, that is, executive and
legislative organs of state government.
(c)  All local authorities, that is, municipalities, panchayats, district
boards, improvement trusts, etc.
(d)  All other authorities, that is, statutory or non-statutory authorities
like LIC, ONGC, SAIL, etc.
Thus, State has been defined in a wider sense so as to include all its
agencies. It is the actions of these agencies that can be challenged in the
courts as violating the Fundamental Rights.
According to the Supreme Court, even a private body or an agency
working as an instrument of the State falls within the meaning of the ‘State’
under Article 12.
LAWS INCONSISTENT WITH FUNDAMENTAL
RIGHTS
Article 13 declares that all laws that are inconsistent with or in derogation
of any of the fundamental rights shall be void. In other words, it
expressively provides for the doctrine of judicial review. This power has
been conferred on the Supreme Court (Article 32) and the high courts
(Article 226) that can declare a law unconstitutional and invalid on the
ground of contravention of any of the Fundamental Rights.
The term ‘law’ in Article 13 has been given a wide connotation so as to
include the following:
(a)  Permanent laws enacted by the Parliament or the state legislatures;
(b)  Temporary laws like ordinances issued by the president or the state
governors;
(c)  Statutory instruments in the nature of delegated legislation
(executive legislation) like order, bye-law, rule, regulation or
notification; and
(d)  Non-legislative sources of law, that is, custom or usage having the
force of law.
Thus, not only a legislation but any of the above can be challenged in the
courts as violating a Fundamental Right and hence, can be declared as void.
Further, Article 13 declares that a constitutional amendment is not a law
and hence cannot be challenged. However, the Supreme Court held in the
Kesavananda Bharati case2
(1973) that a Constitutional amendment can be
challenged on the ground that it violates a fundamental right that forms a
part of the ‘basic structure’ of the Constitution and hence, can be declared
as void.

RIGHT TO EQUALITY
1. Equality before Law and Equal Protection of Laws
Article 14 says that the State shall not deny to any person equality before
the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India. This
provision confers rights on all persons whether citizens or foreigners.
Moreover, the word ‘person’ includes legal persons, viz, statutory
corporations, companies, registered societies or any other type of legal
person.
The concept of ‘equality before law’ is of British origin while the
concept of ‘equal protection of laws’ has been taken from the American
Constitution. The first concept connotes: (a) the absence of any special
privileges in favour of any person, (b) the equal subjection of all persons to
the ordinary law of the land administered by ordinary law courts, and (c) no
person (whether rich or poor, high or low, official or non-official) is above
the law.
The second concept, on the other hand, connotes: (a) the equality of
treatment under equal circumstances, both in the privileges conferred and
liabilities imposed by the laws, (b) the similar application of the same laws
to all persons who are similarly situated, and (c) the like should be treated
alike without any discrimination. Thus, the former is a negative concept
while the latter is a positive concept. However, both of them aim at
establishing equality of legal status, opportunity and justice.
The Supreme Court held that where equals and unequals are treated
differently, Article 14 does not apply. While Article 14 forbids class
legislation, it permits reasonable classification of persons, objects and
transactions by the law. But the classification should not be arbitrary,
artificial or evasive. Rather, it should be based on an intelligible differential
and substantial distinction.
Rule of Law The concept of ‘equality before law’ is an element of the
concept of ‘Rule of Law’, propounded by A.V. Dicey, the British jurist. His
concept has the following three elements or aspects:
(i) Absence of arbitrary power, that is, no man can be punished
except for a breach of law.
(ii) Equality before the law, that is, equal subjection of all citizens
(rich or poor, high or low, official or non-official) to the ordinary
law of the land administered by the ordinary law courts3
 .
(iii) The primacy of the rights of the individual, that is, the
constitution is the result of the rights of the individual as defined
and enforced by the courts of law rather than the constitution
being the source of the individual rights.
The first and the second elements are applicable to the Indian System and
not the third one. In the Indian System, the constitution is the source of the
individual rights.
The Supreme Court held that the ‘Rule of Law’ as embodied in Article
14 is a ‘basic feature’ of the constitution. Hence, it cannot be destroyed
even by an amendment.
Exceptions to Equality The rule of equality before law is not absolute and
there are constitutional and other exceptions to it. These are mentioned
below:
1.  The President of India and the Governor of States enjoy the
following immunities (Article 361):
(i) The President or the Governor is not answerable to any court
for the exercise and performance of the powers and duties of
his office.
(ii) No criminal proceedings shall be instituted or continued
against the President or the Governor in any court during his
term of office.
(iii) No process for the arrest or imprisonment of the President or
the Governor shall be issued from any court during his term
of office.
(iv) No civil proceedings against the President or the Governor
shall be instituted during his term of office in any court in
respect of any act done by him in his personal capacity,
whether before or after he entered upon his office, until the
expiration of two months next after notice has been
delivered to him.
2.  No person shall be liable to any civil or criminal proceedings in any
court in respect of the publication in a newspaper (or by radio or
television) of a substantially true report of any proceedings of either
House of Parliament or either House of the Legislature of a State
(Article 361-A).
3.  No member of Parliament shall be liable to any proceedings in any
court in respect of anything said or any vote given by him in
Parliament or any committee thereof (Article 105).
4.  No member of the Legislature of a state shall be liable to any
proceedings in any court in respect of anything said or any vote given
by him in the Legislature or any committee thereof (Article 194).
5.  Article 31-C is an exception to Article 14. It provides that the laws
made by the state for implementing the Directive Principles contained
in clause (b) or clause (c) of Article 39 cannot be challenged on the
ground that they are violative of Article 14. The Supreme Court held
that “where Article 31-C comes in, Article 14 goes out”.
6.  The foreign sovereigns (rulers), ambassadors and diplomats enjoy
immunity from criminal and civil proceedings.
7.  The UNO and its agencies enjoy the diplomatic immunity.
2. Prohibition of Discrimination on Certain Grounds
Article 15 provides that the State shall not discriminate against any citizen
on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth. The two
crucial words in this provision are ‘discrimination’ and ‘only’. The word
‘discrimination’ means ‘to make an adverse distinction with regard to’ or
‘to distinguish unfavourably from others’. The use of the word ‘only’
connotes that discrimination on other grounds is not prohibited.
The second provision of Article 15 says that no citizen shall be subjected
to any disability, liability, restriction or condition on grounds only of
religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth with regard to (a) access to shops,
public restaurants, hotels and places of public entertainment; or (b) the use
of wells, tanks, bathing ghats, road and places of public resort maintained
wholly or partly by State funds or dedicated to the use of general public.
This provision prohibits discrimination both by the State and private
individuals, while the former provision prohibits discrimination only by the
State.
There are four exceptions to this general rule of non-discrimination:
(a)  The state is permitted to make any special provision for women
and children. For example, reservation of seats for women in local
bodies or provision of free education for children.
(b)  The state is permitted to make any special provision for the
advancement of any socially and educationally backward classes of
citizens or for the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes4
. For example,
reservation of seats or fee concessions in public educational
institutions.
(c)  The state is empowered to make any special provision for the
advancement of any socially and educationally backward classes of
citizens or for the scheduled castes or the scheduled tribes regarding
their admission to educational institutions including private
educational institutions, whether aided or unaided by the state, except
the minority educational institutions.
(d)  The state is empowered to make any special provision for the
advancement of any economically weaker sections of citizens. Further,
the state is allowed to make a provision for the reservation of upto
10% of seats for such sections in admission to educational institutions
including private educational institutions, whether aided or unaided by
the state, except the minority educational institutions. This reservation
of upto 10% would be in addition to the existing reservations. For this
purpose, the economically weaker sections would be notified by the
state from time to time on the basis of family income and other
indicators of economic disadvantage.
Reservation for OBCs in Educational Institutions
The above exception(c) was added by the 93rd Amendment Act of 2005. In
order to give effect to this provision, the Centre enacted the Central
Educational Institutions (Reservation in Admission) Act, 2006, providing a
quota of 27% for candidates belonging to the Other Backward Classes
(OBCs) in all central higher educational institutions including the Indian
Institutes of Technology (IITs) and the Indian Institutes of Management
(IIMs). In April 2008, the Supreme Court upheld the validity of both, the
Amendment Act and the OBC Quota Act. But, the Court directed the
central government to exclude the ‘creamy layer’ (advanced sections)
among the OBCs while implementing the law.
The children of the following different categories of people belong to
‘creamy layer’ among OBCs and thus will not get the quota benefit :
1.  Persons holding constitutional posts like President, Vice-President,
Judges of SC and HCs, Chairman and Members of UPSC and SPSCs,
CEC, CAG and so on.
2.  Group ‘A’ / Class I and Group ‘B’ / Class II Officers of the All
India, Central and State Services; and Employees holding equivalent
posts in PSUs, Banks, Insurance Organisations, Universities etc., and
also in private employment.
3.  Persons who are in the rank of colonel and above in the Army and
equivalent posts in the Navy, the Air Force and the Paramilitary
Forces.
4.  Professionals like doctors, lawyers, engineers, artists, authors,
consultants and so on.
5.  Persons engaged in trade, business and industry.
6.  People holding agricultural land above a certain limit and vacant
land or buildings in urban areas.
7.  Persons having gross annual income of more than ₹8 lakh or
possessing wealth above the exemption limit. In 1993, when the
“creamy layer” ceiling was introduced, it was ₹1 lakh. It was
subsequently revised to ₹2.5 lakh in 2004, ₹4.5 lakh in 2008, ₹6 lakh
in 2013 and ₹8 lakh in 2017.
Reservation for EWSs in Educational Institutions
The above exception (d) was added by the 103rd Amendment Act of 2019.
In order to give effect to this provision, the central government issued an
order (in 2019) providing 10% reservation to the Economically Weaker
Sections (EWSs) in admission to educational institutions. The benefit of
this reservation can be availed by the persons belonging to EWSs who are
not covered under any of the existing schemes of reservations for SCs, STs
and OBCs. The eligibility criteria laid down in this regard is as follows:
1.  Persons whose family has gross annual income below ₹8 lakh are
to be identified as EWSs for the benefit of reservation. The income
would include income from all sources i.e., salary, agriculture,
business, profession etc. and it would be income for the financial year
prior to the year of application.
2.  Persons whose family owns or possesses any one of the following
assets are to be excluded from being identified as EWSs, irrespective
of the family income:
(a)  5 acres of Agricultural land and above.
(b)   Residential flat of 1000 sq.ft. and above.
(c)  Residential plot of 100 sq.yards and above in notified
municipalities.
(d)  Residential plot of 200 sq.yards and above in areas other than the
notified municipalities.
3.  The property held by a family in different locations or different
places / cities would be clubbed while applying the land or property
holding test to determine EWS status.
4.  Family for this purpose would include the person who seeks benefit
of reservation, his/her parents and siblings below the age of 18 years as
also his/ her spouse and children below the age of 18 years.
3. Equality of Opportunity in Public Employment
Article 16 provides for equality of opportunity for all citizens in matters of
employment or appointment to any office under the State. No citizen can be
discriminated against or be ineligible for any employment or office under
the State on grounds of only religion, race, caste, sex, descent, place of birth
or residence.
There are four exceptions to this general rule of equality of opportunity
in public employment:
(a)  Parliament can prescribe residence as a condition for certain
employment or appointment in a state or union territory or local
authority or other authority. As the Public Employment (Requirement
as to Residence) Act of 1957 expired in 1974, there is no such
provision for any state except Andhra Pradesh5
 and Telangana5a
.
(b)  The State can provide for reservation of appointments or posts in
favour of any backward class that is not adequately represented in the
state services.
(c)  A law can provide that the incumbent of an office related to
religious or denominational institution or a member of its governing
body should belong to the particular religion or denomination.
(d)  The state is permitted to make a provision for the reservation of
upto 10% of appointments or posts in favour of any economically
weaker sections of citizens. This reservation of upto 10% would be in
addition to the existing reservation. For this purpose, the economically
weaker sections would be notified by the state from time to time on the
basis of family income and other indicators of economic disadvantage.
Mandal Commission and Aftermath
In 1979, the Morarji Desai Government appointed the Second6 Backward
Classes Commission under the chairmanship of B.P. Mandal, a Member of
Parliament, in terms of Article 340 of the Constitution to investigate the
conditions of the socially and educationally backward classes and suggest
measures for their advancement. The commission submitted its report in
1980 and identified as many as 3743 castes as socially and educationally
backward classes. They constitute nearly 52% component of the population,
excluding the scheduled castes (SCs) and the scheduled tribes (STs). The
commission recommended for reservation of 27% government jobs for the
Other Backward Classes (OBCs) so that the total reservation for all ((SCs,
STs and OBCs) amounts to 50%.7
It was after ten years in 1990 that the V.P.
Singh Government declared reservation of 27% government jobs for the
OBCs. Again in 1991, the Narasimha Rao Government introduced two
changes: (a) preference to the poorer sections among the OBCs in the 27%
quota, i.e., adoption of the economic criteria in granting reservation, and (b)
reservation of another 10% of jobs for poorer (economically backward)
sections of higher castes who are not covered by any existing schemes of
reservation.
In the famous Mandal case8
(1992), the scope and extent of Article 16(4),
which provides for reservation of jobs in favour of backward classes, has
been examined thoroughly by the Supreme Court. Though the Court has
rejected the additional reservation of 10% for poorer sections of higher
castes, it upheld the constitutional validity of 27% reservation for the OBCs
with certain conditions, viz,
(a)  The advanced sections among the OBCs (the creamy layer) should
be excluded from the list of beneficiaries of reservation.
(b)  No reservation in promotions; reservation should be confined to
initial appointments only. Any existing reservation in promotions can
continue for five years only (i.e., upto 1997).
(c)  The total reserved quota should not exceed 50% except in some
extraordinary situations. This rule should be applied every year.
(d)  The ‘carry forward rule’ in case of unfilled (backlog) vacancies is
valid. But it should not violate 50% rule.
(e)  A permanent statutory body should be established to examine
complaints of over-inclusion and under-inclusion in the list of OBCs.
With regard to the above rulings of the Supreme Court, the government
has taken the following actions:
(a)  Ram Nandan Committee was appointed to identify the creamy
layer among the OBCs. It submitted its report in 1993, which was
accepted.
(b)  National Commission for Backward Classes was established in
1993 by an act of Parliament. Its mandate was to examine the
complaints of under-inclusion, over-inclusion or non-inclusion of any
class of citizens in the list of backward classes for the purpose of job
reservation. Later, the 102nd Amendment Act of 2018 conferred a
constitutional status on the commission and also enlarged its functions.
For this purpose, the amendment inserted a new Article 338-B in the
constitution.
(c)  In order to nullify the ruling with regard to reservation in
promotions, the 77th Amendment Act was enacted in 1995. It added a
new provision in Article 16 that empowers the State to provide for
reservation in promotions of any services under the State in favour of
the SCs and STs that are not adequately represented in the state
services. Again, the 85th Amendment Act of 2001 provides for
‘consequential seniority’ in the case of promotion by virtue of rule of
reservation for the government servants belonging to the SCs and STs
with retrospective effect from June 1995.
(d)  The ruling with regard to backlog vacancies was nullified by the
81st Amendment Act of 2000. It added another new provision in
Article 16 that empowers the State to consider the unfilled reserved
vacancies of a year as a separate class of vacancies to be filled up in
any succeeding year or years. Such class of vacancies are not to be
combined with the vacancies of the year in which they are being filled
up to determine the ceiling of 50% reservation on total number of
vacancies of that year. In brief, it ends the 50% ceiling on reservation
in backlog vacancies.
(e)  The 76th Amendment Act of 1994 has placed the Tamil Nadu
Reservations Act9 of 1994 in the Ninth Schedule to protect it from
judicial review as it provided for 69 per cent of reservation, far
exceeding the 50 per cent ceiling.
Reservation for EWSs in Public Employment
The above exception (d) was added by the 103rd Amendment Act of 2019.
In order to give effect to this provision, the central government issued an
order (in 2019) providing 10% reservation to the Economically Weaker
Sections (EWSs) in civil posts and services in the Government of India. The
benefit of this reservation can be availed by the persons belonging to EWSs
who are not covered under any of the existing schemes of reservation for
SCs, STs and OBCs. The eligibility criteria laid down in this regard has
already been explained under Article 15.
Further, the scientific and technical posts which satisfy all the following
conditions can be exempted from the purview of this reservation:
(i) The posts should be in grades above the lower grade in Group A
of the service concerned.
(ii) They should be classified as “scientific or technical” in terms of
Cabinet Secretariat Order (1961), according to which scientific
and technical posts for which qualifications in the natural
sciences or exact sciences or applied sciences or in technology are
prescribed and the incumbents of which have to use that
knowledge in the discharge of their duties.
(iii) The posts should be for conducting research or for organizing,
guiding and directing research.
4. Abolition of Untouchability
Article 17 abolishes ‘untouchability’ and forbids its practice in any form.
The enforcement of any disability arising out of untouchability shall be an
offence punishable in accordance with law.
In 1976, the Untouchability (Offences) Act, 1955 has been
comprehensively amended and renamed as the Protection of Civil Rights
Act, 1955 to enlarge the scope and make penal provisions more stringent.
The act defines civil right as any right accruing to a person by reason of the
abolition of untouchability by Article 17 of the Constitution.
The term ‘untouchability’ has not been defined either in the Constitution
or in the Act. However, the Mysore High Court held that the subject matter
of Article 17 is not untouchability in its literal or grammatical sense but the
‘practice as it had developed historically in the country’. It refers to the
social disabilities imposed on certain classes of persons by reason of their
birth in certain castes. Hence, it does not cover social boycott of a few
individuals or their exclusion from religious services, etc.
The Supreme Court held that the right under Article 17 is available
against private individuals and it is the constitutional obligation of the State
to take necessary action to ensure that this right is not violated.
5. Abolition of Titles
Article 18 abolishes titles and makes four provisions in that regard:
(a)  It prohibits the state from conferring any title (except a military or
academic distinction) on any body, whether a citizen or a foreigner.
(b)  It prohibits a citizen of India from accepting any title from any
foreign state.
(c)  A foreigner holding any office of profit or trust under the state
cannot accept any title from any foreign state without the consent of
the president.
(d)  No citizen or foreigner holding any office of profit or trust under
the State is to accept any present, emolument or office from or under
any foreign State without the consent of the president.
From the above, it is clear that the hereditary titles of nobility like
Maharaja, Raj Bahadur, Rai Bahadur, Rai Saheb, Dewan Bahadur, etc,
which were conferred by colonial States are banned by Article 18 as these
are against the principle of equal status of all.
In 199610
, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutional validity of the
National Awards–Bharat Ratna, Padma Vibhushan, Padma Bhushan and
Padma Sri. It ruled that these awards do not amount to ‘titles’ within the
meaning of Article 18 that prohibits only hereditary titles of nobility.
Therefore, they are not violative of Article 18 as the theory of equality does
not mandate that merit should not be recognised. However, it also ruled that
they should not be used as suffixes or prefixes to the names of awardees.
Otherwise, they should forfeit the awards.
These National Awards were instituted in 1954. The Janata Party
government headed by Morarji Desai discontinued them in 1977. But they
were again revived in 1980 by the Indira Gandhi government.
RIGHT TO FREEDOM
1. Protection of Six Rights
Article 19 guarantees to all citizens the six rights. These are:
(i) Right to freedom of speech and expression.
(ii) Right to assemble peaceably and without arms.
(iii) Right to form associations or unions or co-operative societies.10a
(iv) Right to move freely throughout the territory of India.
(v) Right to reside and settle in any part of the territory of India.
(vi) Right to practice any profession or to carry on any occupation,
trade or business.
Originally, Article 19 contained seven rights. But, the right to acquire,
hold and dispose of property was deleted by the 44th Amendment Act of
1978.
These six rights are protected against only state action and not private
individuals. Moreover, these rights are available only to the citizens and to
shareholders of a company but not to foreigners or legal persons like
companies or corporations, etc.
The State can impose ‘reasonable’ restrictions on the enjoyment of these
six rights only on the grounds mentioned in the Article 19 itself and not on
any other grounds.
Freedom of Speech and Expression
It implies that every citizen has the right to express his views, opinions,
belief and convictions freely by word of mouth, writing, printing, picturing
or in any other manner. The Supreme Court held that the freedom of speech
and expression includes the following:
(a)  Right to propagate one’s views as well as views of others.
(b)  Freedom of the press.
(c)  Freedom of commercial advertisements.
(d)  Right against tapping of telephonic conversation.
(e)  Right to telecast, that is, government has no monopoly on
electronic media.
(f)  Right against bundh called by a political party or organisation.
(g)  Right to know about government activities.
(h)  Freedom of silence.
(i)  Right against imposition of pre-censorship on a newspaper.
(j)  Right to demonstration or picketing but not right to strike.
The State can impose reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the
freedom of speech and expression on the grounds of sovereignty and
integrity of India, security of the state, friendly relations with foreign states,
public order, decency or morality, contempt of court, defamation, and
incitement to an offence.
Freedom of Assembly
Every citizen has the right to assemble peaceably and without arms. It
includes the right to hold public meetings, demonstrations and take out
processions. This freedom can be exercised only on public land and the
assembly must be peaceful and unarmed. This provision does not protect
violent, disorderly, riotous assemblies, or one that causes breach of public
peace or one that involves arms. This right does not include the right to
strike.
The State can impose reasonable restrictions on the exercise of right of
assembly on two grounds, namely, sovereignty and integrity of India and
public order including the maintenance of traffic in the area concerned.
Under Section 144 of Criminal Procedure Code (1973), a magistrate can
restrain an assembly, meeting or procession if there is a risk of obstruction,
annoyance or danger to human life, health or safety or a disturbance of the
public tranquillity or a riot or any affray.
Under Section 141 of the Indian Penal Code, as assembly of five or more
persons becomes unlawful if the object is (a) to resist the execution of any
law or legal process; (b) to forcibly occupy the property of some person; (c)
to commit any mischief or criminal trespass; (d) to force some person to do
an illegal act; and (e) to threaten the government or its officials on
exercising lawful powers.
Freedom of Association
All citizens have the right to form associations or unions or co-operative
societies10b
. It includes the right to form political parties, companies,
partnership firms, societies, clubs, organisations, trade unions or any body
of persons. It not only includes the right to start an association or union but
also to continue with the association or union as such. Further, it covers the
negative right of not to form or join an association or union.
Reasonable restrictions can be imposed on the exercise of this right by
the State on the grounds of sovereignty and integrity of India, public order
and morality. Subject to these restrictions, the citizens have complete liberty
to form associations or unions for pursuing lawful objectives and purposes.
However, the right to obtain recognition of the association is not a
fundamental right.
The Supreme Court held that the trade unions have no guaranteed right to
effective bargaining or right to strike or right to declare a lock-out. The
right to strike can be controlled by an appropriate industrial law.
Freedom of Movement
This freedom entitles every citizen to move freely throughout the territory
of the country. He can move freely from one state to another or from one
place to another within a state. This right underline the idea that India is one
unit so far as the citizens are concerned. Thus, the purpose is to promote
national feeling and not parochialism.
The grounds of imposing reasonable restrictions on this freedom are two,
namely, the interests of general public and the protection of interests of any
scheduled tribe. The entry of outsiders in tribal areas is restricted to protect
the distinctive culture, language, customs and manners of scheduled tribes
and to safeguard their traditional vocation and properties against
exploitation.
The Supreme Court held that the freedom of movement of prostitutes can
be restricted on the ground of public health and in the interest of public
morals. The Bombay High Court validated the restrictions on the movement
of persons affected by AIDS.
The freedom of movement has two dimensions, viz, internal (right to
move inside the country) and external (right to move out of the country and
right to come back to the country). Article 19 protects only the first
dimension. The second dimension is dealt by Article 21 (right to life and
personal liberty).
Freedom of Residence
Every citizen has the right to reside and settle in any part of the territory of
the country. This right has two parts: (a) the right to reside in any part of the
country, which means to stay at any place temporarily, and (b) the right to
settle in any part of the country, which means to set up a home or domicile
at any place permanently.
This right is intended to remove internal barriers within the country or
between any of its parts. This promotes nationalism and avoids narrow
mindedness.
The State can impose reasonable restrictions on the exercise of this right
on two grounds, namely, the interest of general public and the protection of
interests of any scheduled tribes. The right of outsiders to reside and settle
in tribal areas is restricted to protect the distinctive culture, language,
customs and manners of scheduled tribes and to safeguard their traditional
vocation and properties against exploitation. In many parts of the country,
the tribals have been permitted to regulate their property rights in
accordance with their customary rules and laws.
The Supreme Court held that certain areas can be banned for certain
kinds of persons like prostitutes and habitual offenders.
From the above, it is clear that the right to residence and the right to
movement are overlapping to some extent. Both are complementary to each
other.
Freedom of Profession, etc.
All citizens are given the right to practise any profession or to carry on any
occupation, trade or business. This right is very wide as it covers all the
means of earning one’s livelihood.
The State can impose reasonable restrictions on the exercise of this right
in the interest of the general public. Further, the State is empowered to:
(a)  prescribe professional or technical qualifications necessary for
practising any profession or carrying on any occupation, trade or
business; and
(b)  carry on by itself any trade, business, industry or service whether
to the exclusion (complete or partial) of citizens or otherwise.
Thus, no objection can be made when the State carries on a trade,
business, industry or service either as a monopoly (complete or partial) to
the exclusion of citizens (all or some only) or in competition with any
citizen. The State is not required to justify its monopoly.
This right does not include the right to carry on a profession or business
or trade or occupation that is immoral (trafficking in women or children) or
dangerous (harmful drugs or explosives, etc,). The State can absolutely
prohibit these or regulate them through licencing.
2. Protection in Respect of Conviction for Offences
Article 20 grants protection against arbitrary and excessive punishment to
an accused person, whether citizen or foreigner or legal person like a
company or a corporation. It contains three provisions in that direction:
(a)  No ex-post-facto law: No person shall be (i) convicted of any
offence except for violation of a law in force at the time of the
commission of the act, nor (ii) subjected to a penalty greater than that
prescribed by the law in force at the time of the commission of the act.
(b)  No double jeopardy: No person shall be prosecuted and punished
for the same offence more than once.
(c)  No self-incrimination: No person accused of any offence shall be
compelled to be a witness against himself.
An ex-post-facto law is one that imposes penalties retrospectively
(retroactively), that is, upon acts already done or which increases the
penalties for such acts. The enactment of such a law is prohibited by the
first provision of Article 20. However, this limitation is imposed only on
criminal laws and not on civil laws or tax laws. In other words, a civil
liability or a tax can be imposed retrospectively. Further, this provision
prohibits only conviction or sentence under an ex-post-facto criminal law
and not the trial thereof. Finally, the protection (immunity) under this
provision cannot be claimed in case of preventive detention or demanding
security from a person.
The protection against double jeopardy is available only in proceedings
before a court of law or a judicial tribunal. In other words, it is not available
in proceedings before departmental or administrative authorities as they are
not of judicial nature.
The protection against self-incrimination extends to both oral evidence
and documentary evidence. However, it does not extend to (i) compulsory
production of material objects, (ii) compulsion to give thumb impression,
specimen signature, blood specimens, and (iii) compulsory exhibition of the
body. Further, it extends only to criminal proceedings and not to civil
proceedings or proceedings which are not of criminal nature.
3. Protection of Life and Personal Liberty
Article 21 declares that no person shall be deprived of his life or personal
liberty except according to procedure established by law. This right is
available to both citizens and non-citizens.
In the famous Gopalan case11
(1950), the Supreme Court has taken a
narrow interpretation of the Article 21. It held that the protection under
Article 21 is available only against arbitrary executive action and not from
arbitrary legislative action. This means that the State can deprive the right
to life and personal liberty of a person based on a law. This is because of the
expression ‘procedure established by law’ in Article 21, which is different
from the expression ‘due process of law’ contained in the American
Constitution. Hence, the validity of a law that has prescribed a procedure
cannot be questioned on the ground that the law is unreasonable, unfair or
unjust. Secondly, the Supreme Court held that the ‘personal liberty’ means
only liberty relating to the person or body of the individual. But, in Menaka
case12
(1978), the Supreme Court overruled its judgement in the Gopalan
case by taking a wider interpretation of the Article 21. Therefore, it ruled
that the right to life and personal liberty of a person can be deprived by a
law provided the procedure prescribed by that law is reasonable, fair and
just. In other words, it has introduced the American expression ‘due process
of law’. In effect, the protection under Article 21 should be available not
only against arbitrary executive action but also against arbitrary legislative
action. Further, the court held that the ‘right to life’ as embodied in Article
21 is not merely confined to animal existence or survival but it includes
within its ambit the right to live with human dignity and all those aspects of
life which go to make a man’s life meaningful, complete and worth living.
It also ruled that the expression ‘Personal Liberty’ in Article 21 is of the
widest amplitude and it covers a variety of rights that go to constitute the
personal liberties of a man.
The Supreme Court has reaffirmed its judgement in the Menaka case in
the subsequent cases. It has declared the following rights as part of Article
21:
(1)  Right to live with human dignity.
(2)  Right to decent environment including pollution free water and air
and protection against hazardous industries.
(3)  Right to livelihood.
(4)  Right to privacy.
(5)  Right to shelter.
(6)  Right to health.
(7)  Right to free education up to 14 years of age.
(8)  Right to free legal aid.
(9)  Right against solitary confinement.
(10)  Right to speedy trial.
(11)  Right against handcuffing.
(12)  Right against inhuman treatment.
(13)  Right against delayed execution.
(14)  Right to travel abroad.
(15)  Right against bonded labour.
(16)  Right against custodial harassment.
(17)  Right to emergency medical aid.
(18)  Right to timely medical treatment in government hospital.
(19)  Right not to be driven out of a state.
(20)  Right to fair trial.
(21)  Right of prisoner to have necessities of life.
(22)  Right of women to be treated with decency and dignity.
(23)  Right against public hanging.
(24)  Right to road in hilly areas.
(25)  Right to information.
(26)  Right to reputation.
(27)  Right of appeal from a judgement of conviction
(28)  Right to family pension
(29)  Right to social and economic justice and empowerment
(30)  Right against bar fetters
(31)  Right to appropriate life insurance policy
(32)  Right to sleep
(33)  Right to freedom from noise pollution
(34)  Right to sustainable development
(35)  Right to opportunity.
4. Right to Education
Article 21 A declares that the State shall provide free and compulsory
education to all children of the age of six to fourteen years in such a manner
as the State may determine. Thus, this provision makes only elementary
education a Fundamental Right and not higher or professional education.
This provision was added by the 86th Constitutional Amendment Act of
2002. This amendment is a major milestone in the country’s aim to achieve
‘Education for All’. The government described this step as ‘the dawn of the
second revolution in the chapter of citizens’ rights’.
Even before this amendment, the Constitution contained a provision for
free and compulsory education for children under Article 45 in Part IV.
However, being a directive principle, it was not enforceable by the courts.
Now, there is scope for judicial intervention in this regard.
This amendment changed the subject matter of Article 45 in directive
principles. It now reads–‘The state shall endeavour to provide early
childhood care and education for all children until they complete the age of
six years.’ It also added a new fundamental duty under Article 51A that
reads–‘It shall be the duty of every citizen of India to provide opportunities
for education to his child or ward between the age of six and fourteen
years’.
In 1993 itself, the Supreme Court recognised a Fundamental Right to
primary education in the right to life under Article 21. It held that every
child or citizen of this country has a right to free education until he
completes the age of 14 years. Thereafter, his right to education is subject to
the limits of economic capacity and development of the state. In this
judgement, the Court overruled its earlier judgement (1992) which declared
that there was a fundamental right to education up to any level including
professional education like medicine and engineering.
In pursuance of Article 21A, the Parliament enacted the Right of
Children to Free and
Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009. This Act seeks to provide that
every child has a right to be provided full time elementary education of
satisfactory and equitable quality in a formal school which satisfies certain
essential norms and standards. This legislation is anchored in the belief that
the values of equality, social justice and democracy and the creation of a
just and humane society can be achieved only through provision of
inclusive elementary education to all.12a
5. Protection Against Arrest and Detention
Article 22 grants protection to persons who are arrested or detained.
Detention is of two types, namely, punitive and preventive. Punitive
detention is to punish a person for an offence committed by him after trial
and conviction in a court. Preventive detention, on the other hand, means
detention of a person without trial and conviction by a court. Its purpose is
not to punish a person for a past offence but to prevent him from
committing an offence in the near future. Thus, preventive detention is only
a precautionary measure and based on suspicion.
The Article 22 has two parts–the first part deals with the cases of
ordinary law and the second part deals with the cases of preventive
detention law.
(a)  The first part of Article 22 confers the following rights on a person
who is arrested or detained under an ordinary law:
(i) Right to be informed of the grounds of arrest.
(ii) Right to consult and be defended by a legal practitioner.
(iii) Right to be produced before a magistrate within 24 hours,
including the journey time.
(iv) Right to be released after 24 hours unless the magistrate
authorises further detention.
These safeguards are not available to an enemy alien or a person
arrested or detained under a preventive detention law.
The Supreme Court also ruled that the arrest and detention in the
first part of Article 22 do not cover arrest under the orders of a court,
civil arrest, arrest on failure to pay the income tax, and deportation of
an alien. They apply only to an act of a criminal or quasi-criminal
nature or some activity prejudicial to public interest.
(b)  The second part of Article 22 grants protection to persons who are
arrested or detained under a preventive detention law. This protection
is available to both citizens as well as aliens and includes the
following:
(i) The detention of a person cannot exceed three months unless
an advisory board reports sufficient cause for extended
detention. The board is to consist of judges of a high court.
(ii) The grounds of detention should be communicated to the
detenu. However, the facts considered to be against the
public interest need not be disclosed.
(iii) The detenu should be afforded an opportunity to make a
representation against the detention order.
Article 22 also authorises the Parliament to prescribe (a) the
circumstances and the classes of cases in which a person can be detained for
more than three months under a preventive detention law without obtaining
the opinion of an advisory board; (b) the maximum period for which a
person can be detained in any classes of cases under a preventive detention
law; and (c) the procedure to be followed by an advisory board in an
inquiry.
The 44th Amendment Act of 1978 has reduced the period of detention
without obtaining the opinion of an advisory board from three to two
months. However, this provision has not yet been brought into force, hence,
the original period of three months still continues.
The Constitution has divided the legislative power with regard to
preventive detention between the Parliament and the state legislatures. The
Parliament has exclusive authority to make a law of preventive detention
for reasons connected with defence, foreign affairs and the security of India.
Both the Parliament as well as the state legislatures can concurrently make
a law of preventive detention for reasons connected with the security of a
state, the maintenance of public order and the maintenance of supplies and
services essential to the community.
The preventive detention laws made by the Parliament are:
(a)  Preventive Detention Act, 1950. Expired in 1969.
(b)  Maintenance of Internal Security Act (MISA), 1971. Repealed in
1978.
(c)  Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling
Activities Act (COFEPOSA), 1974.
(d)  National Security Act (NASA), 1980.
(e)  Prevention of Blackmarketing and Maintenance of Supplies of
Essential Commodities Act (PBMSECA), 1980.
(f)  Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act (TADA),
1985. Repealed in 1995.
(g)  Prevention of Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic
Substances Act (PITNDPSA), 1988.
(h)  Prevention of Terrorism Act (POTA), 2002. Repealed in 2004.
(i)  Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), 1967, as amended
in 2004, 2008, 2012 and 2019.
It is unfortunate to know that no democratic country in the world has
made preventive detention as an integral part of the Constitution as has
been done in India. It is unknown in USA. It was resorted to in Britain only
during first and second world war time. In India, preventive detention
existed even during the British rule. For example, the Bengal State
Prisoners Regulation of 1818 and the Defence of India Act of 1939
provided for preventive detention.
RIGHT AGAINST EXPLOITATION
1. Prohibition of Traffic in Human Beings and Forced Labour
Article 23 prohibits traffic in human beings, begar (forced labour) and other
similar forms of forced labour. Any contravention of this provision shall be
an offence punishable in accordance with law. This right is available to both
citizens and non-citizens. It protects the individual not only against the
State but also against private persons.
The expression ‘traffic in human beings’ include (a) selling and buying
of men, women and children like goods; (b) immoral traffic in women and
children, including prostitution; (c) devadasis; and (d) slavery. To punish
these acts, the Parliament has made the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act13
,
1956.
The term ‘begar ’ means compulsory work without remuneration. It was
a peculiar Indian system under which the local zamin-dars sometimes used
to force their tenants to render services without any payment. In addition to
begar, the Article 23 prohibits other ‘similar forms of forced labour’ like
‘bonded labour’. The term ‘forced labour’ means compelling a person to
work against his will. The word ‘force’ includes not only physical or legal
force but also force arising from the compulsion of economic
circumstances, that is, working for less than the minimum wage. In this
regard, the Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976; the Minimum
Wages Act, 1948; the Contract Labour Act, 1970 and the Equal
Remuneration Act, 1976 were made.
Article 23 also provides for an exception to this provision. It permits the
State to impose compulsory service for public purposes, as for example,
military service or social service, for which it is not bound to pay. However,
in imposing such service, the State is not permitted to make any
discrimination on grounds only of religion, race, caste or class.
2. Prohibition of Employment of Children in Factories, etc.
Article 24 prohibits the employment of children below the age of 14 years
in any factory, mine or other hazardous activities like construction work or
railway. But it does not prohibit their employment in any harmless or
innocent work.
The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act, 1986, is the most
important law in this direction. In addition, the Employment of Children
Act, 1938; the Factories Act, 1948; the Mines Act, 1952; the Merchant
Shipping Act, 1958; the Plantation Labour Act, 1951; the Motor Transport
Workers Act, 1951; Apprentices Act, 1961; the Bidi and Cigar Workers
Act, 1966; and other similar acts prohibit the employment of children below
certain age.
In 1996, the Supreme Court directed the establishment of Child Labour
Rehabilitation Welfare Fund in which the offending employer should
deposit a fine of ₹20,000 for each child employed by him. It also issued
directions for the improvement of education, health and nutrition of
children.
The Commissions for Protection of Child Rights Act, 2005 was enacted
to provide for the establishment of a National Commission and State
Commissions for Protection of Child Rights and Children’s Courts for
providing speedy trial of offences against children or of violation of child
rights.
In 2006, the government banned the employment of children as domestic
servants or workers in business establishments like hotels, dhabas,
restaurants, shops, factories, resorts, spas, tea-shops and so on. It warned
that anyone employing children below 14 years of age would be liable for
prosecution and penal action.
The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016,
amended the Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act, 1986. It has
renamed the Principal Act as the Child and Adolescent Labour (Prohibition
and Regulation) Act, 1986.
RIGHT TO FREEDOM OF RELIGION
1. Freedom of Conscience and Free Profession, Practice and
Propagation of Religion
Article 25 says that all persons are equally entitled to freedom of
conscience and the right to freely profess, practice and propagate religion.
The implications of these are:
(a)  Freedom of conscience: Inner freedom of an individual to mould
his relation with God or Creatures in whatever way he desires.
(b)  Right to profess: Declaration of one’s religious beliefs and faith
openly and freely.
(c)  Right to practice: Performance of religious worship, rituals,
ceremonies and exhibition of beliefs and ideas.
(d)  Right to propagate: Transmission and dissemination of one’s
religious beliefs to others or exposition of the tenets of one’s religion.
But, it does not include a right to convert another person to one’s own
religion. Forcible conversions impinge on the ‘freedom of conscience’
guaranteed to all the persons alike.
From the above, it is clear that Article 25 covers not only religious
beliefs (doctrines) but also religious practices (rituals). Moreover, these
rights are available to all persons–citizens as well as non-citizens.
However, these rights are subject to public order, morality, health and
other provisions relating to fundamental rights. Further, the State is
permitted to:
(a)  regulate or restrict any economic, financial, political or other
secular activity associated with religious practice; and
(b)  provide for social welfare and reform or throw open Hindu
religious institutions of a public character to all classes and sections of
Hindus.
Article 25 also contains two explanations: one, wearing and carrying of
kirpans is to be included in the profession of the Sikh religion; and two, the
Hindus, in this context, include Sikhs, Jains and Buddhists.14
2. Freedom to Manage Religious Affairs
According to Article 26, every religious denomination or any of its section
shall have the following rights:
(a)  Right to establish and maintain institutions for religious and
charitable purposes;
(b)  Right to manage its own affairs in matters of religion;
(c)  Right to own and acquire movable and immovable property; and
(d)  Right to administer such property in accordance with law.
Article 25 guarantees rights of individuals, while Article 26 guarantees
rights of religious denominations or their sections. In other words, Article
26 protects collective freedom of religion. Like the rights under Article 25,
the rights under Article 26 are also subject to public order, morality and
health but not subject to other provisions relating to the Fundamental
Rights.
The Supreme Court held that a religious denomination must satisfy three
conditions:
(a)  It should be a collection of individuals who have a system of
beliefs (doctrines) which they regard as conducive to their spiritual
well-being;
(b)  It should have a common organisation; and
(c)  It should be designated by a distinctive name.
Under the above criteria, the Supreme Court held that the ‘Ramakrishna
Mission’ and ‘Ananda Marga’ are religious denominations within the Hindu
religion. It also held that Aurobindo Society is not a religious denomination.
3. Freedom from Taxation for Promotion of a Religion
Article 27 lays down that no person shall be compelled to pay any taxes for
the promotion or maintenance of any particular religion or religious
denomination. In other words, the State should not spend the public money
collected by way of tax for the promotion or maintenance of any particular
religion. This provision prohibits the State from favouring, patronising and
supporting one religion over the other. This means that the taxes can be
used for the promotion or maintenance of all religions.
This provision prohibits only levy of a tax and not a fee. This is because
the purpose of a fee is to control secular administration of religious
institutions and not to promote or maintain religion. Thus, a fee can be
levied on pilgrims to provide them some special service or safety measures.
Similarly, a fee can be levied on religious endowments for meeting the
regulation expenditure.
4. Freedom from Attending Religious Instruction
Under Article 28, no religious instruction shall be provided in any
educational institution wholly maintained out of State funds. However, this
provision shall not apply to an educational institution administered by the
State but established under any endowment or trust, requiring imparting of
religious instruction in such institution.
Further, no person attending any educational institution recognised by the
State or receiving aid out of State funds shall be required to attend any
religious instruction or worship in that institution without his consent. In
case of a minor, the consent of his guardian is needed.
Thus, Article 28 distinguishes between four types of educational
institutions:
(a)  Institutions wholly maintained by the State.
(b)  Institutions administered by the State but established under any
endowment or trust.
(c)  Institutions recognised by the State.
(d)  Institutions receiving aid from the State.
In (a), religious instruction is completely prohibited while in (b), religious
instruction is permitted. In (c) and (d), religious instruction is permitted on
a voluntary basis.
CULTURAL AND EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS
1. Protection of Interests of Minorities
Article 29 provides that any section of the citizens residing in any part of
India having a distinct language, script or culture of its own, shall have the
right to conserve the same. Further, no citizen shall be denied admission
into any educational institution maintained by the State or receiving aid out
of State funds on grounds only of religion, race, caste, or language.
The first provision protects the right of a group while the second
provision guarantees the right of a citizen as an individual irrespective of
the community to which he belongs.
Article 29 grants protection to both religious minorities as well as
linguistic minorities. However, the Supreme Court held that the scope of
this article is not necessarily restricted to minorities only, as it is commonly
assumed to be. This is because of the use of words ‘section of citizens’ in
the Article that include minorities as well as majority.
The Supreme Court also held that the right to conserve the language
includes the right to agitate for the protection of the language. Hence, the
political speeches or promises made for the conservation of the language of
a section of the citizens does not amount to corrupt practice under the
Representation of the People Act, 1951.
2. Right of Minorities to Establish and Administer Educational
Institutions
Article 30 grants the following rights to minorities, whether religious or
linguistic:
(a)  All minorities shall have the right to establish and administer
educational institutions of their choice.
(b)  The compensation amount fixed by the State for the compulsory
acquisition of any property of a minority educational institution shall
not restrict or abrogate the right guaranteed to them. This provision
was added by the 44th Amendment Act of 1978 to protect the right of
minorities in this regard. The Act deleted the right to property as a
Fundamental Right (Article 31).
(c)  In granting aid, the State shall not discriminate against any
educational institution managed by a minority.
Thus, the protection under Article 30 is confined only to minorities
(religious or linguistic) and does not extend to any section of citizens (as
under Article 29). However, the term ‘minority’ has not been defined
anywhere in the Constitution.
The right under Article 30 also includes the right of a minority to impart
education to its children in its own language.
Minority educational institutions are of three types:
(a)  institutions that seek recognition as well as aid from the State;
(b)  institutions that seek only recognition from the State and not aid;
and
(c)  institutions that neither seek recognition nor aid from the State.
The institutions of first and second type are subject to the regulatory
power of the state with regard to syllabus prescription, academic standards,
discipline, sanitation, employment of teaching staff and so on. The
institutions of third type are free to administer their affairs but subject to
operation of general laws like contract law, labour law, industrial law, tax
law, economic regulations, and so on.
In a judgement delivered in the Secretary of Malankara Syrian Catholic
College case14a
(2007), the Supreme Court has summarized the general
principles relating to establishment and administration of minority
educational institutions in the following way :
1.  The right of minorities to establish and administer educational
institutions of their choice comprises the following rights :
(i) To choose its governing body in whom the founders of the
institution have faith and confidence to conduct and manage
the affairs of the institution;
(ii) To appoint teaching staff (teachers/ lecturers and headmasters/princi-pals) as also non-teaching staff; and to take
action if there is dereliction of duty on the part of any of its
employees;
(iii) To admit eligible students of their choice and to set up a
reasonable fee structure; and
(iv) To use its properties and assets for the benefit of the
institution.
2.  The right conferred on minorities under Article 30 is only to ensure
equality with the majority and not intended to place the minorities in a
more advantageous position vis-a-vis the majority. There is no reverse
discrimination in favour of minorities. The general laws of the land
relating to national interest, national security, social welfare, public
order, morality, health, sanitation, taxation etc., applicable to all, will
equally apply to minority institutions also.
3.  The right to establish and administer educational institutions is not
absolute. Nor does it include the right to maladminister. There can be
regulatory measures for ensuring educational character and standards
and maintaining academic excellence. There can be checks on
administration as are necessary to ensure that the administration is
efficient and sound, so as to serve the academic needs of the
institution. Regulations made by the State concerning generally the
welfare of students and teachers, regulations laying down eligibility
criteria and qualifications for appointment, as also conditions of
service of employees (both teaching and non-teaching), regulations to
prevent exploitation or oppression of employees, and regulations
prescribing syllabus and curriculum of study fall under this category.
Such regulations do not in any manner interfere with the right under
Article 30(1).
4.  Subject to the eligibility conditions/ qualifications prescribed by the
State being met, the unaided minority educational institutions will
have the freedom to appoint teachers/lecturers by adopting any rational
procedure of selection.
5.  Extention of aid by the State, does not alter the nature and character
of the minority educational institutions. The conditions can be imposed
by the State to ensure proper utilization of the aid, without however
diluting or abridging the right under Article 30(1).
RIGHT TO CONSTITUTIONAL REMEDIES
A mere declaration of fundamental rights in the Constitution is
meaningless, useless and worthless without providing an effective
machinery for their enforcement, if and when they are violated. Hence,
Article 32 confers the right to remedies for the enforcement of the
fundamental rights of an aggrieved citizen. In other words, the right to get
the Fundamental Rights protected is in itself a fundamental right. This
makes the fundamental rights real. That is why Dr. Ambedkar called Article
32 as the most important article of the Constitution–‘an Article without
which this constitution would be a nullity. It is the very soul of the
Constitution and the very heart of it’. The Supreme Court has ruled that
Article 32 is a basic feature of the Constitution. Hence, it cannot be
abridged or taken away even by way of an amendment to the Constitution.
It contains the following four provisions:
(a)  The right to move the Supreme Court by appropriate proceedings
for the enforcement of the Fundamental Rights is guaranteed.
(b)  The Supreme Court shall have power to issue directions or orders
or writs for the enforcement of any of the fundamental rights. The
writs issued may include habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition,
certiorari and quo-warranto.
(c)  Parliament can empower any other court to issue directions, orders
and writs of all kinds. However, this can be done without prejudice to
the above powers conferred on the Supreme Court. Any other court
here does not include high courts because Article 226 has already
conferred these powers on the high courts.
(d)  The right to move the Supreme Court shall not be suspended
except as otherwise provided for by the Constitution. Thus the
Constitution provides that the President can suspend the right to move
any court for the enforcement of the fundamental rights during a
national emergency (Article 359).
It is thus clear that the Supreme Court has been constituted as the
defender and guarantor of the fundamental rights of the citizens. It has been
vested with the ‘original’ and ‘wide’ powers for that purpose. Original,
because an aggrieved citizen can directly go to the Supreme Court, not
necessarily by way of appeal. Wide, because its power is not restricted to
issuing of orders or directions but also writs of all kinds.
The purpose of Article 32 is to provide a guaranteed, effective,
expeditious, inexpensive and summary remedy for the protection of the
fundamental rights. Only the Fundamental Rights guaranteed by the
Constitution can be enforced under Article 32 and not any other right like
non-fundamental constitutional rights, statutory rights, customary rights and
so on. The violation of a fundamental right is the sine qua non for the
exercise of the right conferred by Article 32. In other words, the Supreme
Court, under Article 32, cannot determine a question that does not involve
Fundamental Rights. Article 32 cannot be invoked simply to determine the
constitutionality of an executive order or a legislation unless it directly
infringes any of the fundamental rights.
In case of the enforcement of Fundamental Rights, the jurisdiction of the
Supreme Court is original but not exclusive. It is concurrent with the
jurisdiction of the high court under Article 226. It vests original powers in
the high court to issue directions, orders and writs of all kinds for the
enforcement of the Fundamental Rights. It means when the Fundamental
Rights of a citizen are violated, the aggrieved party has the option of
moving either the high court or the Supreme Court directly.
Since the right guaranteed by Article 32 (ie, the right to move the
Supreme Court where a fundamental right is infringed) is in itself a
fundamental right, the availability of alternate remedy is no bar to relief
under Article 32. However, the Supreme Court has ruled that where relief
through high court is available under Article 226, the aggrieved party
should first move the high court.
WRITS–TYPES AND SCOPE
The Supreme Court (under Article 32) and the high courts (under Article
226) can issue the writs of habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition,
certiorari and quo-warranto. Further, the Parliament (under Article 32) can
empower any other court to issue these writs. Since no such provision has
been made so far, only the Supreme Court and the high courts can issue the
writs and not any other court. Before 1950, only the High Courts of
Calcutta, Bombay and Madras had the power to issue the writs. Article 226
now empowers all the high courts to issue the writs.
These writs are borrowed from English law where they are known as
‘prerogative writs’. They are so called in England as they were issued in the
exercise of the prerogative of the King who was, and is still, described as
the ‘fountain of justice’. Later, the high court started issuing these writs as
extraordinary remedies to uphold the rights and liberties of the British
people.
The writ jurisdiction of the Supreme Court differs from that of a high
court in three respects:
1.  The Supreme Court can issue writs only for the enforcement of
fundamental rights whereas a high court can issue writs not only for
the enforcement of Fundamental Rights but also for any other purpose.
The expression ‘for any other purpose’ refers to the enforcement of an
ordinary legal right. Thus, the writ jurisdiction of the Supreme Court,
in this respect, is narrower than that of high court.
2.  The Supreme Court can issue writs against a person or government
throughout the territory of India whereas a high court can issue writs
against a person residing or against a government or authority located
within its territorial jurisdiction only or outside its territorial
jurisdiction only if the cause of action arises within its territorial
jurisdiction.15 Thus, the territorial jurisdiction of the Supreme Court for
the purpose of issuing writs is wider than that of a high court.
3.  A remedy under Article 32 is in itself a Fundamental Right and
hence, the Supreme Court may not refuse to exercise its writ
jurisdiction. On the other hand, a remedy under Article 226 is
discretionary and hence, a high court may refuse to exercise its writ
jurisdiction. Article 32 does not merely confer power on the Supreme
Court as Article 226 does on a high court to issue writs for the
enforcement of fundamental rights or other rights as part of its general
jurisdiction. The Supreme Court is thus constituted as a defender and
guarantor of the fundamental rights.
Now, we will proceed to understand the meaning and scope of different
kinds of writs mentioned in Articles 32 and 226 of the Constitution:
Habeas Corpus
It is a Latin term which literally means ‘to have the body of’. It is an order
issued by the court to a person who has detained another person, to produce
the body of the latter before it. The court then examines the cause and
legality of detention. It would set the detained person free, if the detention
is found to be illegal. Thus, this writ is a bulwark of individual liberty
against arbitrary detention.
The writ of habeas corpus can be issued against both public authorities
as well as private individuals. The writ, on the other hand, is not issued
where the (a) detention is lawful, (b) the proceeding is for contempt of a
legislature or a court, (c) detention is by a competent court, and (d)
detention is outside the jurisdiction of the court.
Mandamus
It literally means ‘we command’. It is a command issued by the court to a
public official asking him to perform his official duties that he has failed or
refused to perform. It can also be issued against any public body, a
corporation, an inferior court, a tribunal or government for the same
purpose.
The writ of mandamus cannot be issued (a) against a private individual
or body; (b) to enforce departmental instruction that does not possess
statutory force; (c) when the duty is discretionary and not mandatory; (d) to
enforce a contractual obligation; (e) against the president of India or the
state governors; and (f) against the chief justice of a high court acting in
judicial capacity.
Prohibition
Literally, it means ‘to forbid’. It is issued by a higher court to a lower court
or tribunal to prevent the latter from exceeding its jurisdiction or usurping a
jurisdiction that it does not possess. Thus, unlike mandamus that directs
activity, the prohibition directs inactivity.
The writ of prohibition can be issued only against judicial and quasijudicial authorities. It is not available against administrative authorities,
legislative bodies, and private individuals or bodies.
Certiorari
In the literal sense, it means ‘to be certified’ or ‘to be informed’. It is issued
by a higher court to a lower court or tribunal either to transfer a case
pending with the latter to itself or to squash the order of the latter in a case.
It is issued on the grounds of excess of jurisdiction or lack of jurisdiction or
error of law. Thus, unlike prohibition, which is only preventive, certiorari is
both preventive as well as curative.
Previously, the writ of certiorari could be issued only against judicial and
quasi-judicial authorities and not against administrative authorities.
However, in 1991, the Supreme Court ruled that the certiorari can be issued
even against administrative authorities affecting rights of individuals.
Like prohibition, certiorari is also not available against legislative bodies
and private individuals or bodies.
Quo-Warranto
In the literal sense, it means ‘by what authority or warrant’. It is issued by
the court to enquire into the legality of claim of a person to a public office.
Hence, it prevents illegal usurpation of public office by a person.
The writ can be issued only in case of a substantive public office of a
permanent character created by a statute or by the Constitution. It cannot be
issued in cases of ministerial office or private office.
Unlike the other four writs, this can be sought by any interested person
and not necessarily by the aggrieved person.
ARMED FORCES AND FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS
Article 33 empowers the Parliament to restrict or abrogate the fundamental
rights of the members of armed forces, para-military forces, police forces,
intelligence agencies and analogous forces. The objective of this provision
is to ensure the proper discharge of their duties and the maintenance of
discipline among them.
The power to make laws under Article 33 is conferred only on Parliament
and not on state legislatures. Any such law made by Parliament cannot be
challenged in any court on the ground of contravention of any of the
fundamental rights.
Accordingly, the Parliament has enacted the Army Act (1950), the Navy
Act (1950), the Air Force Act (1950), the Police Forces (Restriction of
Rights) Act, 1966, the Border Security Force Act and so on. These impose
restrictions on their freedom of speech, right to form associations, right to
be members of trade unions or political associations, right to communicate
with the press, right to attend public meetings or demonstrations, etc.
Table 7.3  Martial Law Vs National Emergency

Constitution. It is explicit.
The expression‘members of the armed forces’ also covers such
employees of the armed forces as barbers, carpenters, mechanics, cooks,
chowkidars, bootmakers, tailors who are non-combatants.
A parliamentary law enacted under Article 33 can also exclude the court
martial (tribunals established under the military law) from the writ
jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and the high courts, so far as the
enforcement of Fundamental Rights is concerned.
MARTIAL LAW AND FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS
Article 34 provides for the restrictions on fundamental rights while martial
law is in force in any area within the territory of India. It empowers the
Parliament to indemnify any government servant or any other person for
any act done by him in connection with the maintenance or restoration of
order in any area where martial law was in force. The Parliament can also
validate any sentence passed, punishment inflicted, forfeiture ordered or
other act done under martial law in such area.
The Act of Indemnity made by the Parliament cannot be challenged in
any court on the ground of contravention of any of the fundamental rights.
The concept of martial law has been borrowed in India from the English
common law. However, the expression ‘martial law’ has not been defined
anywhere in the Constitution. Literally, it means ‘military rule’. It refers to
a situation where civil administration is run by the military authorities
according to their own rules and regulations framed outside the ordinary
law. It thus imply the suspension of ordinary law and the government by
military tribunals. It is different from the military law that is applicable to
the armed forces.
There is also no specific or express provision in the Constitution that
authorises the executive to declare martial law. However, it is implicit in
Article 34 under which martial law can be declared in any area within the
territory of India. The martial law is imposed under the extraordinary
circumstances like war, invasion, insurrection, rebellion, riot or any violent
resistance to law. Its justification is to repel force by force for maintaining
or restoring order in the society.
During the operation of martial law, the military authorities are vested
with abnormal powers to take all necessary steps. They impose restrictions
and regulations on the rights of the civilians, can punish the civilians and
even condemn them to death.
The Supreme Court held that the declaration of martial law does not ipso
facto result in the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus.
The declaration of a martial law under Article 34 is different from the
declaration of a national emergency under Article 352. The differences
between the two are summarised in Table 7.3.
EFFECTING CERTAIN FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS
Article 35 lays down that the power to make laws, to give effect to certain
specified fundamental rights shall vest only in the Parliament and not in the
state legislatures. This provision ensures that there is uniformity throughout
India with regard to the nature of those fundamental rights and punishment
for their infringement. In this direction, Article 35 contains the following
provisions:
1. The Parliament shall have (and the legislature of a state shall not have)
power to make laws with respect to the following matters:
(a)  Prescribing residence as a condition for certain employments or
appointments in a state or union territory or local authority or other
authority (Article 16).
(b)  Empowering courts other than the Supreme Court and the high
courts to issue directions, orders and writs of all kinds for the
enforcement of fundamental rights (Article 32).
(c)  Restricting or abrogating the application of Fundamental Rights to
members of armed forces, police forces, etc. (Article 33).
(d)  Indemnifying any government servant or any other person for any
act done during the operation of martial law in any area (Article 34).
2. Parliament shall have (and the legislature of a state shall not have)
powers to make laws for prescribing punishment for those acts that are
declared to be offences under the fundamental rights. These include the
following:
(a)  Untouchability (Article 17).
(b)  Traffic in human beings and forced labour (Article 23).
Further, the Parliament shall, after the commencement of the
Constitution, make laws for prescribing punishment for the above acts, thus
making it obligatory on the part of the Parliament to enact such laws.
3. Any law in force at the commencement of the Constitution with respect
to any of the matters specified above is to continue in force until altered or
repealed or amended by the Parliament.
It should be noted that Article 35 extends the competence of the
Parliament to make a law on the matters specified above, even though some
of those matters may fall within the sphere of the state legislatures (i.e.,
State List).
PRESENT POSITION OF RIGHT TO PROPERTY
Originally, the right to property was one of the seven fundamental rights
under Part III of the Constitution. It was dealt by Article 19(1) (f) and
Article 31. Article 19(1)(f) guaranteed to every citizen the right to acquire,
hold and dispose of property. Article 31, on the other hand, guaranteed to
every person, whether citizen or non-citizen, right against deprivation of his
property. It provided that no person shall be deprived of his property except
by authority of law. It empowered the State to acquire or requisition the
property of a person on two conditions: (a) it should be for public purpose,
and ( b) it should provide for payment of compensation (amount) to the
owner.
Since the commencement of the Constitution, the Fundamental Right to
Property has been the most controversial. It has caused confrontations
between the Supreme Court and the Parliament. It has led to a number of
Constitutional amendments, that is, 1st, 4th, 7th, 25th, 39th, 40th and 42nd
Amendments. Through these amendments, Articles 31A, 31B and 31C have
been added and modified from time to time to nullify the effect of Supreme
Court judgements and to protect certain laws from being challenged on the
grounds of contravention of Fundamental Rights. Most of the litigation
centred around the obligation of the state to pay compensation for
acquisition or requisition of private property.
Therefore, the 44th Amendment Act of 1978 abolished the right to
property as a Fundamental Right by repealing Article 19(1) (f) and Article
31 from Part III. Instead, the Act inserted a new Article 300A in Part XII
under the heading ‘Right to Property’. It provides that no person shall be
deprived of his property except by authority of law. Thus, the right to
property still remains a legal right or a constitutional right, though no longer
a fundamental right. It is not a part of the basic structure of the Constitution.
The right to property as a legal right (as distinct from the Fundamental
Rights) has the following implications:
(a)  It can be regulated ie, curtailed, abridged or modified without
constitutional amend-ment by an ordinary law of the Parliament.
(b)  It protects private property against executive action but not against
legislative action.
(c)  In case of violation, the aggrieved person cannot directly move the
Supreme Court under Article 32 (right to constitutional remedies
including writs) for its enforcement. He can move the High Court
under Article 226.
(d)  No guaranteed right to compensation in case of acquisition or
requisition of the private property by the state.
Though the Fundamental Right to Property under Part III has been
abolished, the Part III still carries two provisions which provide for the
guaranteed right to compensation in case of acquisition or requisition of the
private property by the state. These two cases where compensation has to be
paid are:
(a)  When the State acquires the property of a minority educational
institution (Article 30); and
(b)  When the State acquires the land held by a person under his
personal cultivation and the land is within the statutory ceiling limits
(Article 31 A).
The first provision was added by the 44th Amendment Act (1978), while
the second provision was added by the 17th Amendment Act (1964).
Further, Articles 31A, 31B and 31C have been retained as exceptions to
the fundamental rights.
EXCEPTIONS TO FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS
1. Saving of Laws Providing for Acquisition of Estates, etc.
Article 31A16 saves five categories of laws from being challenged and
invalidated on the ground of contravention of the fundamental rights
conferred by Article 14 (equality before law and equal protection of laws)
and Article 19 (protection of six rights in respect of speech, assembly,
movement, etc.). They are related to agricultural land reforms, industry and
commerce and include the following:
(a)  Acquisition of estates17
 and related rights by the State;
(b)  Taking over the management of properties by the State;
(c)  Amalgamation of corporations;
(d)  Extinguishment or modification of rights of directors or
shareholders of corporations; and
(e)  Extinguishment or modification of mining leases.
Article 31A does not immunise a state law from judicial review unless it
has been reserved for the president’s consideration and has received his
assent.
This Article also provides for the payment of compensation at market
value when the state acquires the land held by a person under his personal
cultivation and the land is within the statutory ceiling limit.
2. Validation of Certain Acts and Regulations
Article 31B saves the acts and regulations included in the Ninth Schedule18
from being challenged and invalidated on the ground of contravention of
any of the fundamental rights. Thus, the scope of Article 31B is wider than
Article 31A. Article 31B immunises any law included in the Ninth
Schedule from all the fundamental rights whether or not the law falls under
any of the five categories specified in Article 31A.
However, in a significant judgement delivered in I.R. Coelho case18a
(2007), the Supreme Court ruled that there could not be any blanket
immunity from judicial review of laws included in the Ninth Schedule. The
court held that judicial review is a ‘basic feature’ of the constitution and it
could not be taken away by putting a law under the Ninth Schedule. It said
that the laws placed under the Ninth Schedule after April 24, 1973, are open
to challenge in court if they violated fundamentals rights guaranteed under
Articles 14, 15, 19 and 21 or the ‘basic structure’ of the constitution. It was
on April 24, 1973, that the Supreme Court first propounded the doctrine of
‘basic structure’ or ‘basic features’ of the constitution in its landmark
verdict in the Kesavananda Bharati Case.19
Originally (in 1951), the Ninth Schedule contained only 13 acts and
regulations but at present (in 2016) their number is 282.20 Of these, the acts
and regulations of the state legislature deal with land reforms and abolition
of the zamindari system and that of the Parliament deal with other matters.
3. Saving of Laws Giving Effect to Certain Directive Principles
Article 31C, as inserted by the 25th Amendment Act of 1971, contained the
following two provisions:
(a)  No law that seeks to implement the socialistic directive principles
specified in Article 39(b)21 or (c)22 shall be void on the ground of
contravention of the fundamental rights conferred by Article 14
(equality before law and equal protection of laws) or Article 19
(protection of six rights in respect of speech, assembly, movement,
etc.)
(b)  No law containing a declaration that it is for giving effect to such
policy shall be questioned in any court on the ground that it does not
give effect to such a policy.
In the Kesavananda Bharati case23
(1973), the Supreme Court declared
the above second provision of Article 31C as unconstitutional and invalid
on the ground that judicial review is a basic feature of the Constitution and
hence, cannot be taken away. However, the above first provision of Article
31C was held to be constitutional and valid.
The 42nd Amendment Act (1976) extended the scope of the above first
provision of Article 31C by including within its protection any law to
implement any of the directive principles specified in Part IV of the
Constitution and not merely in Article 39 (b) or (c). However, this extention
was declared as unconstitutional and invalid by the Supreme Court in the
Minerva Mills case24
 (1980).
CRITICISM OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS
The Fundamental Rights enshrined in Part III of the Constitution have met
with a wide and varied criticism. The arguments of the critics are:
1. Excessive Limitations
They are subjected to innumerable exceptions, restrictions, qualifications
and explanations. Hence, the critics remarked that the Constitution grants
Fundamental Rights with one hand and takes them away with the other.
Jaspat Roy Kapoor went to the extent of saying that the chapter dealing
with the fundamental rights should be renamed as ‘Limitaions on
Fundamental Rights’ or ‘Fundamental Rights and Limitations Thereon’.
2. No Social and Economic Rights
The list is not comprehensive as it mainly consists of political rights. It
makes no provision for important social and economic rights like right to
social security, right to work, right to employment, right to rest and leisure
and so on. These rights are made available to the citizens of advanced
democratic countries. Also, the socialistic constitutions of erstwhile USSR
or China provided for such rights.
3. No Clarity
They are stated in a vague, indefinite and ambiguous manner. The various
phrases and words used in the chapter like ‘public order’, ‘minorities’,
‘reasonable restriction’, ‘public interest’ and so on are not clearly defined.
The language used to describe them is very complicated and beyond the
comprehension of the common man. It is alleged that the Constitution was
made by the lawyers for the lawyers. Sir Ivor Jennings called the
Constitution of India a ‘paradise for lawyers’.
4. No Permanency
They are not sacrosanct or immutable as the Parliament can curtail or
abolish them, as for example, the abolition of the fundamental right to
property in 1978. Hence, they can become a play tool in the hands of
politicians having majority support in the Parliament. The judicially
innovated ‘doctrine of basic structure’ is the only limitation on the authority
of Parliament to curtail or abolish the fundamental right.
5. Suspension During Emergency
The suspension of their enforcement during the operation of National
Emergency (except Articles 20 and 21) is another blot on the efficacy of
these rights. This provision cuts at the roots of democratic system in the
country by placing the rights of the millions of innocent people in
continuous jeopardy. According to the critics, the Fundamental Rights
should be enjoyable in all situations–Emergency or no Emergency.
6. Expensive Remedy
The judiciary has been made responsible for defending and protecting these
rights against the interference of the legislatures and executives. However,
the judicial process is too expensive and hinders the common man from
getting his rights enforced through the courts. Hence, the critics say that the
rights benefit mainly the rich section of the Indian Society.
7. Preventive Detention
The critics assert that the provision for preventive detention (Article 22)
takes away the spirit and substance of the chapter on fundamental rights. It
confers arbitrary powers on the State and negates individual liberty. It
justifies the criticism that the Constitution of India deals more with the
rights of the State against the individual than with the rights of the
individual against the State. Notably, no democratic country in the world
has made preventive detention as an integral part of their Constitutions as
has been made in India.
8. No Consistent Philosophy
According to some critics, the chapter on fundamental rights is not the
product of any philosophical principle. Sir Ivor Jennings expressed this
view when he said that the Fundamental Rights proclaimed by the Indian
Constitution are based on no consistent phi-losophy.
25 The critics say that
this creates difficulty for the Supreme Court and the high courts in
interpreting the fundamental rights.
SIGNIFICANCE OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS
In spite of the above criticism and shortcomings, the Fundamental Rights
are significant in the following respects:
1.  They constitute the bedrock of democratic system in the country.
2.  They provide necessary conditions for the material and moral
protection of man.
3.  They serve as a formidable bulwark of individual liberty.
4.  They facilitate the establishment of rule of law in the country.
5.  They protect the interests of minorities and weaker sections of
society.
6.  They strengthen the secular fabric of the Indian State.
7.  They check the absoluteness of the authority of the government.
8.  They lay down the foundation stone of social equality and social
justice.
9.  They ensure the dignity and respect of individuals.
10.  They facilitate the participation of people in the political and
administrative process.
RIGHTS OUTSIDE PART III
Besides the Fundamental Rights included in Part III, there are certain other
rights contained in other parts of the Constitution. These rights are known
as constitutional rights or legal rights or non-fundamental rights. They are:
1.  No tax shall be levied or collected except by authority of law
(Article 265 in Part XII).
2.  No person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law
(Article 300-A in Part XII).
3.  Trade, commerce and intercourse throughout the territory of India
shall be free (Article 301 in Part XIII).
Even though the above rights are also equally justiciable, they are
different from the Fundamental Rights. In case of violation of a
Fundamental Right, the aggrieved person can directly move the Supreme
Court for its enforcement under Article 32, which is in itself a fundamental
right. But, in case of violation of the above rights, the aggrieved person
cannot avail this constitutional remedy. He can move the High Court by an
ordinary suit or under Article 226 (writ jurisdiction of high court).

social institutions which time and circumstances have developed in
India. The result is a series of complex formulae, in twenty-four
articles, some of them lengthy, which must become the basis of a vast
and complicated case law’.
8 Directive Principles of State Policy
The Directive Principles of State Policy are enumerated in Part IV of the
Constitution from Articles 36 to 511
. The framers of the Constitution
borrowed this idea from the Irish Constitution of 1937, which had copied it
from the Spanish Constitution. Dr. B.R. Ambedkar described these
principles as ‘novel features’ of the Indian Constitution. The Directive
Principles along with the Fundamental Rights contain the philosophy of the
Constitution and is the soul of the Constitution. Granville Austin has
described the Directive Principles and the Fundamental Rights as the
‘Conscience of the Constitution’2
 .
FEATURES OF THE DIRECTIVE PRINCIPLES
1.  The phrase ‘Directive Principles of State Policy’ denotes the ideals
that the State should keep in mind while formulating policies and
enacting laws. These are the constitutional instructions or
recommendations to the State in legislative, executive and
administrative matters. According to Article 36, the term ‘State’ in
Part IV has the same meaning as in Part III dealing with Fundamental
Rights. Therefore, it includes the legislative and executive organs of
the central and state governments, all local authorities and all other
public authorities in the country.
2.  The Directive Principles resemble the ‘Instrument of Instructions’
enumerated in the Government of India Act of 1935. In the words of
Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, ‘the Directive Principles are like the instrument of
instructions, which were issued to the Governor-General and to the
Governors of the colonies of India by the British Government under
the Government of India Act of 1935. What is called Directive
Principles is merely another name for the instrument of instructions.
The only difference is that they are instructions to the legislature and
the executive’.
3.  The Directive Principles constitute a very comprehensive
economic, social and political programme for a modern democratic
State. They aim at realising the high ideals of justice, liberty, equality
and fraternity as outlined in the Preamble to the Constitution. They
embody the concept of a ‘welfare state’ and not that of a ‘police state’,
which existed during the colonial era3
. In brief, they seek to establish
economic and social democracy in the country.
4.  The Directive Principles are non-justiciable in nature, that is, they
are not legally enforceable by the courts for their violation. Therefore,
the government (Central, state and local) cannot be compelled to
implement them. Nevertheless, the Constitution (Article 37) itself says
that these principles are fundamental in the governance of the country
and it shall be the duty of the State to apply these principles in making
laws.
5.  The Directive Principles, though non-justiciable in nature, help the
courts in examining and determining the constitutional validity of a
law. The Supreme Court has ruled many a times that in determining
the constitutionality of any law, if a court finds that the law in question
seeks to give effect to a Directive Principle, it may consider such law
to be ‘reasonable’ in relation to Article 14 (equality before law) or
Article 19 (six freedoms) and thus save such law from
unconstitutionality.
CLASSIFICATION OF THE DIRECTIVE PRINCIPLES
The Constitution does not contain any classification of Directive Principles.
However, on the basis of their content and direction, they can be classified
into three broad categories, viz, socialistic, Gandhian and liberalintellectual.
Socialistic Principles
These principles reflect the ideology of socialism. They lay down the
framework of a democratic socialist state, aim at providing social and
economic justice, and set the path towards welfare state. They direct the
state:
1.  To promote the welfare of the people by securing a social order
permeated by justice–social, economic and politi-cal–and to minimise
inequalities in income, status, facilities and opportuni-ties4
 (Article 38).
2.  To secure (a) the right to adequate means of livelihood for all
citizens; (b) the equitable distribution of material resources of the
community for the common good; (c) prevention of concentration of
wealth and means of production; (d) equal pay for equal work for men
and women; (e) preservation of the health and strength of workers and
children against forcible abuse; and (f) opportunities for healthy
development of children5
 (Article 39).
3.  To promote equal justice and to provide free legal aid to the poor6
(Article 39 A).
4.  To secure the right to work, to education and to public assistance in
cases of unemployment, old age, sickness and disablement (Article
41).
5.  To make provision for just and humane conditions of work and
maternity relief (Article 42).
6.  To secure a living wage7
, a decent standard of life and social and
cultural opportunities for all workers (Article 43).
7.  To take steps to secure the participation of workers in the
management of indus-tries8
 (Article 43 A).
8.  To raise the level of nutrition and the standard of living of people
and to improve public health (Article 47).
Gandhian Principles
These principles are based on Gandhian ideology. They represent the
programme of reconstruction enunciated by Gandhi during the national
movement. In order to fulfil the dreams of Gandhi, some of his ideas were
included as Directive Principles. They require the State:
1.  To organise village panchayats and endow them with necessary
powers and authority to enable them to function as units of selfgovernment (Article 40).
2.  To promote cottage industries on an individual or co-operation basis
in rural areas (Article 43).
3.  To promote voluntary formation, autonomous functioning,
democratic control and professional management of cooperative
societies8a
 (Article 43B).
4.  To promote the educational and economic interests of SCs, STs, and
other weaker sections of the society and to protect them from social
injustice and exploitation (Article 46).
5.  To prohibit the consumption of intoxicating drinks and drugs which
are injurious to health (Article 47).
6.  To prohibit the slaughter of cows, calves and other milch and
draught cattle and to improve their breeds (Article 48).
Liberal-Intellectual Principles
The principles included in this category represent the ideology of
liberalism. They direct the state:
1.  To secure for all citizens a uniform civil code throughout the
country (Article 44).
2.  To provide early childhood care and education for all children until
they complete the age of six years9
 (Article 45).
3.  To organise agriculture and animal husbandry on modern and
scientific lines (Article 48).
4.  To protect and improve the environment and to safeguard forests
and wild life10
 (Article 48 A).
5.  To protect monuments, places and objects of artistic or historic
interest which are declared to be of national importance (Article 49).
6.  To separate the judiciary from the executive in the public services
of the State (Article 50).
7.  To promote international peace and security and maintain just and
honourable relations between nations; to foster respect for
international law and treaty obligations, and to encourage settlement of
international disputes by arbitration (Article 51).
NEW DIRECTIVE PRINCIPLES
The 42nd Amendment Act of 1976 added four new Directive Principles to
the original list. They require the State:
1.  To secure opportunities for healthy development of children
(Article 39).
2.  To promote equal justice and to provide free legal aid to the poor
(Article 39 A).
3.  To take steps to secure the participation of workers in the
management of industries (Article 43 A).
4.  To protect and improve the environment and to safeguard forests
and wild life (Article 48 A).
The 44th Amendment Act of 1978 added one more Directive Principle,
which requires the State to minimise inequalities in income, status, facilities
and opportunities (Article 38).
The 86th Amendment Act of 2002 changed the subject-matter of Article
45 and made elementary education a fundamental right under Article 21 A.
The amended directive requires the State to provide early childhood care
and education for all children until they complete the age of six years.
The 97th Amendment Act of 2011 added a new Directive Principle
relating to cooperative societies. It requires the state to promote voluntary
formation, autonomous functioning, democratic control and professional
management of co-operative societies (Article 43B).
SANCTION BEHIND DIRECTIVE PRINCIPLES
Sir B.N. Rau, the Constitutional Advisor to the Constituent Assembly,
recommended that the rights of an individual should be divided into two
categories–justiciable and non-justiciable, which was accepted by the
Drafting Committee. Consequently, the Fundamental Rights, which are
justiciable in nature, are incorporated in Part III and the Directive
Principles, which are non-justiciable in nature, are incorporated in Part IV
of the Constitution.
Though the Directive Principles are non-justiciable, the Constitution
(Article 37) makes it clear that ‘these principles are fundamental in the
governance of the country and it shall be the duty of the state to apply these
principles in making laws’. Thus, they impose a moral obligation on the
state authorities for their application, but the real force behind them is
political, that is, public opinion. As observed by Alladi Krishna Swamy
Ayyar, ‘no ministry responsible to the people can afford light-heartedly to
ignore the provisions in Part IV of the Constitution’. Similarly, Dr. B.R.
Ambedkar said in the Constituent Assembly that ‘a government which rests
on popular vote can hardly ignore the Directive Principles while shaping its
policy. If any government ignores them, it will certainly have to answer for
that before the electorate at the election time’11
 .
The framers of the Constitution made the Directive Principles nonjusticiable and legally non-enforceable because:
1.  The country did not possess sufficient financial resources to
implement them.
2.  The presence of vast diversity and backwardness in the country
would stand in the way of their implementation.
3.  The newly born independent Indian State with its many
preoccupations might be crushed under the burden unless it was free to
decide the order, the time, the place and the mode of fulfilling them.
‘The Constitution makers, therefore, taking a pragmatic view, refrained
from giving teeth to these principles. They believed more in an awakened
public opinion rather than in court procedures as the ultimate sanction for
the fulfilment of these principles’12
 .
CRITICISM OF THE DIRECTIVE PRINCIPLES
The Directive Principles of State Policy have been criticised by some
members of the Constituent Assembly as well as other constitutional and
political experts on the following grounds:
1. No Legal Force
The Directives have been criticised mainly because of their non-justiciable
character. While K.T. Shah dubbed them as ‘pious superfluities’ and
compared them with ‘a cheque on a bank, payable only when the resources
of the bank permit’13
, Nasiruddin contended that these principles are ‘no
better than the new year’s resolutions, which are broken on the second of
January’. Even as T.T. Krishnamachari described the Directives as ‘a
veritable dustbin of sentiments’, K C Wheare called them as a ‘manifesto of
aims and aspirations’ and opined that they serve as mere ‘moral homily’,
and Sir Ivor Jennings thought they are only as ‘pious aspirations’.
2. Illogically Arranged
Critics opine that the Directives are not arranged in a logical manner based
on a consistent philosophy. According to N Srinivasan, ‘the Directives are
neither properly classified nor logically arranged. The declaration mixes up
relatively unimportant issues with the most vital economic and social
questions. It combines rather incongruously the modern with the old and
provisions suggested by the reason and science with provisions based
purely on sentiment and prejudice’14
. Sir Ivor Jennings too pointed out that
these principles have no consistent philosophy.
3. Conservative
According to Sir Ivor Jennings, the Directives are based on the political
philosophy of the 19th century England. He remarked: ‘The ghosts of
Sydney Webb and Beatrice Webb stalk through the pages of the text. Part
IV of the Constitution expresses Fabian Socialism without the socialism’.
He opined that the Directives ‘are deemed to be suitable in India in the
middle of the twentieth century. The question whether they are suitable for
the twenty-first century cannot be answered; but it is quite probable that
they will be entirely out moded.15
4. Constitutional Conflict
K Santhanam has pointed out that the Directives lead to a constitutional
conflict (a) between the Centre and the states, (b) between the President and
the Prime Minister, and (c) between the governor and the chief minister.
According to him, the Centre can give directions to the states with regard to
the implementation of these principles, and in case of non-compliance, can
dismiss the state government. Similarly, when the Prime Minister gets a bill
(which violates the Directive Principles) passed by the Parliament, the
president may reject the bill on the ground that these principles are
fundamental to the governance of the country and hence, the ministry has
no right to ignore them. The same constitutional conflict may occur
between the governor and the chief minister at the state level.
UTILITY OF DIRECTIVE PRINCIPLES
In spite of the above criticisms and shortcomings, the Directive Principles
are not an unnecessary appendage to the Constitution. The Constitution
itself declares that they are fundamental to the governance of the country.
According to L.M. Singhvi, an eminent jurist and diplomat, ‘the Directives
are the life giving provisions of the Constitution. They constitute the stuff
of the Constitution and its philosophy of social justice’16
. M.C. Chagla,
former Chief Justice of India, is of the opinion that, ‘if all these principles
are fully carried out, our country would indeed be a heaven on earth. India
would then be not only democracy in the political sense, but also a welfare
state looking after the welfare of its citizens’17
. Dr. B.R. Ambedkar had
pointed out that the Directives have great value because they lay down that
the goal of Indian polity is ‘economic democracy’ as distinguished from
‘political democracy’. Granville Austin opined that the Directive Principles
are ‘aimed at furthering the goals of the social revolution or to foster this
revolution by establishing the conditions necessary for its achivement’18
. Sir
B.N. Rau, the constitutional advisor to the Constituent Assembly, stated that
the Directive Principles are intended as ‘moral precepts for the authorities
of the state. They have at least an educative value.’
According to M.C. Setalvad, the former Attorney General of India, the
Directive Principles, although confer no legal rights and create no legal
remedies, are significant and useful in the following ways:
1.  They are like an ‘Instrument of Instructions’ or general
recommendations addressed to all authorities in the Indian Union.
They remind them of the basic principles of the new social and
economic order, which the Constitution aims at building.
2.  They have served as useful beacon-lights to the courts. They have
helped the courts in exercising their power of judicial review, that is,
the power to determine the constitutional validity of a law.
3.  They form the dominating background to all State action,
legislative or executive and also a guide to the courts in some respects.
4.  They amplify the Preamble, which solemnly resolves to secure to
all citizens of India justice, liberty, equality and fraternity.
The Directives also play the following roles:
1.  They facilitate stability and continuity in domestic and foreign
policies in political, economic and social spheres in spite of the
changes of the party in power.
2.  They are supplementary to the fundamental rights of the citizens.
They are intended to fill in the vacuum in Part III by providing for
social and economic rights.
3.  Their implementation creates a favourable atmosphere for the full
and proper enjoyment of the fundamental rights by the citizens.
Political democracy, without economic democracy, has no meaning.
4.  They enable the opposition to exercise influence and control over
the operations of the government. The Opposition can blame the ruling
party on the ground that its activities are opposed to the Directives.
5.  They serve as a crucial test for the performance of the government.
The people can examine the policies and programmes of the
government in the light of these constitutional declarations.
6.  They serve as common political manifesto. ‘A ruling party,
irrespective of its political ideology, has to recognise the fact that these
principles are intended to be its guide, philosopher and friend in its
legislative and executive acts’19
 .
CONFLICT BETWEEN FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND
DIRECTIVE PRINCIPLES
The justiciability of Fundamental Rights and non-justiciability of Directive
Principles on the one hand and the moral obligation of State to implement
Directive Principles (Article 37) on the other hand have led to a conflict
between the two since the commencement of the Constitution. In the
Champakam Dorairajan case20
(1951), the Supreme Court ruled that in case
of any conflict between the Fundamental Rights and the Directive
Principles, the former would prevail. It declared that the Directive
Principles have to conform to and run as subsidiary to the Fundamental
Rights. But, it also held that the Fundamental Rights could be amended by
the Parliament by enacting constitutional amendment acts. As a result, the
Parliament made the First Amendment Act (1951), the Fourth Amendment
Act (1955) and the Seventeenth Amendment Act (1964) to implement some
of the Directives.
The above situation underwent a major change in 1967 following the
Supreme Court’s judgement in the Golaknath case21
(1967). In that case, the
Supreme Court ruled that the Parliament cannot take away or abridge any of
the Fundamental Rights, which are ‘sacrosanct’ in nature. In other words,
the Court held that the Fundamental Rights cannot be amended for the
implementation of the Directive Principles.
The Parliament reacted to the Supreme Court’s judgement in the
Golaknath Case (1967) by enacting the 24th Amendment Act (1971) and
the 25th Amendment Act (1971). The 24th Amendment Act declared that
the Parliament has the power to abridge or take away any of the
Fundamental Rights by enacting Constitutional Amendment Acts. The 25th
Amendment Act inserted a new Article 31C which contained the following
two provisions:
1.  No law which seeks to implement the socialistic Directive
Principles specified in Article 39 (b)22 and (c)23 shall be void on the
ground of contravention of the Fundamental Rights conferred by
Article 14 (equality before law and equal protection of laws), Article
19 (protection of six rights in respect of speech, assembly, movement,
etc) or Article 31 (right to property).
2.  No law containing a declaration for giving effect to such policy
shall be questioned in any court on the ground that it does not give
effect to such a policy.
In the Kesavananda Bharati case24
(1973), the Supreme Court declared
the above second provision of Article 31C as unconstitutional and invalid
on the ground that judicial review is a basic feature of the Constitution and
hence, cannot be taken away. However, the above first provision of Article
31C was held to be constitutional and valid.

7.  The courts cannot declare a law
violative of any of the Directive Principles
as unconstitutional and invalid. However,
they can uphold the validity of a law on the
ground that it was enacted to give effect to
a directive.
Later, the 42nd Amendment Act (1976) extended the scope of the above
first provision of Article 31C by including within its protection any law to
implement any of the Directive Principles and not merely those specified in
Article 39 (b) and (c). In other words, the 42nd Amendment Act accorded
the position of legal primacy and supremacy to the Directive Principles over
the Fundamental Rights conferred by Articles 14, 19 and 31. However, this
extension was declared as unconstitutional and invalid by the Supreme
Court in the Minerva Mills case25
(1980). It means that the Directive
Principles were once again made subordinate to the Fundamental Rights.
But the Fundamental Rights conferred by Article 14 and Article 19 were
accepted as subordinate to the Directive Principles specified in Article 39
(b) and (c). Further, Article 31 (right to property) was abolished by the 44th
Amendment Act (1978).
In the Minerva Mills case (1980), the Supreme Court also held that ‘the
Indian Constitution is founded on the bedrock of the balance between the
Fundamental Rights and the Directive Principles. They together constitute
the core of commitment to social revolution. They are like two wheels of a
chariot, one no less than the other. To give absolute primacy to one over the
other is to disturb the harmony of the Constitution. This harmony and
balance between the two is an essential feature of the basic structure of the
Constitution. The goals set out by the Directive Principles have to be
achieved without the abrogation of the means provided by the Fundamental
Rights’.
Therefore, the present position is that the Fundamental Rights enjoy
supremacy over the Directive Principles. Yet, this does not mean that the
Directive Principles cannot be implemented. The Parliament can amend the
Fundamental Rights for implementing the Directive Principles, so long as
the amendment does not damage or destroy the basic structure of the
Constitution.
IMPLEMENTATION OF DIRECTIVE PRINCIPLES
Since 1950, the successive governments at the Centre and in the states have
made several laws and formulated various programmes for implementing
the Directive Principles. These are mentioned below:
1.  The Planning Commission was established in 1950 to take up the
development of the country in a planned manner. The successive Five
Year Plans aimed at securing socio-economic justice and reducing
inequalities of income, status and opportunities. In 2015, the Planning
Commission was replaced by a new body called NITI Aayog (National
Institution for Transforming India).
2.  Almost all the states have passed land reform laws to bring changes
in the agrarian society and to improve the conditions of the rural
masses. These measures include (a) abolition of intermediaries like
zamindars, jagirdars, inamdars, etc; (b) tenancy reforms like security
of tenure, fair rents, etc; (c) imposition of ceilings on land holdings;
(d) distribution of surplus land among the landless labourers; and (e)
cooperative farming.
3.  The Minimum Wages Act (1948), the Payment of Wages Act
(1936), the Payment of Bonus Act (1965), the Contract Labour
Regulation and Abolition Act (1970), the Child Labour Prohibition
and Regulation Act (1986), the Bonded Labour System Abolition Act
(1976), the Trade Unions Act (1926), the Factories Act (1948), the
Mines Act (1952), the Industrial Disputes Act (1947), the Workmen’s
Compensation Act (1923) and so on have been enacted to protect the
interests of the labour sections. In 2006, the government banned the
child labour. In 2016, the Child Labour Prohibition and Regulation Act
(1986) was renamed as the Child and Adolescent Labour Prohibition
and Regulation Act, 1986.
4.  The Maternity Benefit Act (1961) and the Equal Remuneration Act
(1976) have been made to protect the interests of women workers.
5.  Various measures have been taken to utilise the financial resources
for promoting the common good.These include nationalisation of life
insurance (1956), the nationalisation of fourteen leading commercial
banks (1969), nationalisation of general insurance (1971), abolition of
Privy Purses (1971) and so on.
6.  The Legal Services Authorities Act (1987) has established a nationwide network to provide free and competent legal aid to the poor and
to organise lok adalat for promoting equal justice. Lok adalat is a
statutory forum for conciliatory settlement of legal disputes. It has
been given the status of a civil court. Its awards are enforceable,
binding on the parties and final as no appeal lies before any court
against them.
7.  Khadi and Village Industries Board, Khadi and Village Industries
Commission, Small-Scale Industries Board, National Small Industries
Corporation, Handloom Board, Handicrafts Board, Coir Board, Silk
Board and so on have been set up for the development of cottage
industries in rural areas.
8.  The Community Development Programme (1952), Hill Area
Development Programme (1960), Drought-Prone Area Programme
(1973), Minimum Needs Programme (1974), Integrated Rural
Development Programme (1978), Jawahar Rozgar Yojana (1989),
Swarnajayanti Gram Swarozgar Yojana (1999), Sampoorna Grameena
Rozgar Yojana (2001), National Rural Employment Guarantee
Programme (2006) and so on have been launched for raising the
standard of living of people.
9.  The Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972 and the Forest (Conservation)
Act, 1980, have been enacted to safeguard the wildlife and the forests
respectively. Further, the Water and Air Acts have provided for the
establishment of the Central and State Pollution Control Boards, which
are engaged in the protection and improvement of environment. The
National Forest Policy (1988) aims at the protection, conservation and
development of forests.
10.  Agriculture has been modernised by providing improved
agricultural inputs, seeds, fertilisers and irrigation facilities. Various
steps have also been taken to organise animal husbandry on modern
and scientific lines.
11.  Three-tier panchayati raj system (at village, taluka and zila levels)
has been introduced to translate into reality Gandhiji’s dream of every
village being a republic. The 73rd Amendment Act (1992) has been
enacted to provide constitutional status and protection to these
panchayati raj institutions.
12.  Seats are reserved for SCs, STs and other weaker sections in
educational institutions, government services and representative
bodies. The Untouchability (Offences) Act, 1955, which was renamed
as the Protection of Civil Rights Act in 1976 and the Scheduled Castes
and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, have been
enacted to protect the SCs and STs from social injustice and
exploitation. The 65th Constitutional Amendment Act of 1990
established the National Commission for Scheduled Castes and
Scheduled Tribes to protect the interests of SCs and STs. Later, the 89th
Constitutional Amendment Act of 2003 bifurcated this combined
commission into two separate bodies, namely, National Commission
for Schedule Castes and National Commission for Schedule Tribes.
12a.  Various national-level commissions have been established to
promote and protect the social, educational and economic interests of
the weaker sections of the society. These include the National
Commission for Backward Classes (1993), the National Commission
for Minorities (1993), the National Commission for Women (1992)
and the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (2007).
Further, the 102nd Amendment Act of 2018 conferred a constitutional
status on the National Commission for Backward Classes and also
enlarged its functions.
12b.  In 2019, the central government issued orders providing 10%
reservation to the Economically Weaker Sections (EWSs) in admission
to educational institutions and civil posts and services in the
Government of India. The benefit of this reservation can be availed by
the persons belonging to EWSs who are not covered under any of the
existing schemes of reservations for SCs, STs and OBCs. This
reservation was facilitated by the 103rd
 Amendment Act of 2019.
13.  The Criminal Procedure Code (1973) separated the judiciary from
the executive in the public services of the state. Prior to this separation,
the district authorities like the collector, the sub-divisional officer, the
tehsildar and so on used to exercise judicial powers along with the
traditional executive powers. After the separation, the judicial powers
were taken away from these executive authorities and vested in the
hands of district judicial magistrates who work under the direct control
of the state high court.
14.  The Ancient and Historical Monument and Archaeological Sites
and Remains Act (1951) has been enacted to protect the monuments,
places and objects of national importance.
15.  Primary health centres and hospitals have been established
throughout the country to improve the public health. Also, special
programmes have been launched to eradicate widespread diseases like
malaria, TB, leprosy, AIDS, cancer, filaria, kala-azar, guineaworm,
yaws, Japanese encephalitis and so on.
16.  Laws to prohibit the slaughter of cows, calves, and bullocks have
been enacted in some states.
17.  Some states have initiated the old age pension schemes for people
above 65 years.
18.  India has been following the policy of non-alignment and
panchsheel to promote international peace and security.
In spite of the above steps by the Central and state governments, the
Directive Principles have not been implemented fully and effectively due to
several reasons like inadequate financial resources, unfavourable socioeconomic conditions, population explosion, strained Centre-state relations
and so on.
DIRECTIVES OUTSIDE PART IV
Apart from the Directives included in Part IV, there are some other
Directives contained in other Parts of the Constitution. They are:
1.  Claims of SCs and STs to Services: The claims of the members of
the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes shall be taken into
consideration, consistently with the maintenance of efficiency of
administration, in the making of appointments to services and posts in
connection with the affairs of the Union or a State (Article 335 in Part
XVI).
2.  Instruction in mother tongue: It shall be the endeavour of every
state and every local authority within the state to provide adequate
facilities for instruction in the mother-tongue at the primary stage of
education to children belonging to linguistic minority groups (Article
350-A in Part XVII).
3.  Development of the Hindi Language: It shall be the duty of the
Union to promote the spread of the Hindi language and to develop it so
that it may serve as a medium of expression for all the elements of the
composite culture of India (Article 351 in Part XVII).
The above Directives are also non-jus-ticiable in nature. However, they
are also given equal importance and attention by the judiciary on the ground
that all parts of the constitution must be read together.

9 Fundamental Duties
Though the rights and duties of the citizens are correlative and
inseparable, the original constitution contained only the fundamental rights
and not the fundamental duties. In other words, the framers of the
Constitution did not feel it necessary to incorporate the fundamental duties
of the citizens in the Constitution. However, they incorporated the duties of
the State in the Constitution in the form of Directive Principles of State
Polity. Later in 1976, the fundamental duties of citizens were added in the
Constitution. In 2002, one more Fundamental Duty was added.
The Fundamental Duties in the Indian Constitution are inspired by the
Constitution of erstwhile USSR. Notably, none of the Constitutions of
major democratic countries like USA, Canada, France, Germany, Australia
and so on specifically contain a list of duties of citizens. Japanese
Constitution is, perhaps, the only democratic Constitution in world which
contains a list of duties of citizens. The socialist countries, on the contrary,
gave equal importance to the fundamental rights and duties of their citizens.
Hence, the Constitution of erstwhile USSR declared that the citizen’s
exercise of their rights and freedoms was inseparable from the performance
of their duties and obligations.
SWARAN SINGH COMMITTEE
RECOMMENDATIONS
In 1976, the Congress Party set up the Sardar Swaran Singh Committee to
make recommendations about fundamental duties, the need and necessity of
which was felt during the operation of the internal emergency (1975–1977).
The committee recommended the inclusion of a separate chapter on
fundamental duties in the Constitution. It stressed that the citizens should
become conscious that in addition to the enjoyment of rights, they also have
certain duties to perform as well. The Congress Government at Centre
accepted these recommendations and enacted the 42nd Constitutional
Amendment Act in 1976. This amendment added a new part, namely, Part
IVA to the Constitution. This new part consists of only one Article, that is,
Article 51A which for the first time specified a code of ten fundamental
duties of the citizens. The ruling Congress party declared the non-inclusion
of fundamental duties in the Constitution as a historical mistake and
claimed that what the framers of the Constitution failed to do was being
done now.
Though the Swaran Singh Committee suggested the incorporation of
eight Fundamental Duties in the Constitution, the 42nd Constitutional
Amendment Act (1976) included ten Fundamental Duties.
Interestingly, certain recommendations of the Committee were not
accepted by the Congress Party and hence, not incorporated in the
Constitution. These include:
1.  The Parliament may provide for the imposition of such penalty or
punishment as may be considered appropriate for any non-compliance
with or refusal to observe any of the duties.
2.  No law imposing such penalty or punishment shall be called in
question in any court on the ground of infringement of any of
Fundamental Rights or on the ground of repugnancy to any other
provision of the Constitution.
3.  Duty to pay taxes should also be a Fundamental Duty of the
citizens.
LIST OF FUNDAMENTAL DUTIES
According to Article 51A, it shall be the duty of every citizen of India:
(a)  to abide by the Constitution and respect its ideals and institutions,
the National Flag and the National Anthem;
(b)  to cherish and follow the noble ideals that inspired the national
struggle for freedom;
(c)  to uphold and protect the sovereignty, unity and integrity of India;
(d)  to defend the country and render national service when called
upon to do so;
(e)  to promote harmony and the spirit of common brotherhood
amongst all the people of India transcending religious, linguistic and
regional or sectional diversities and to renounce practices derogatory
to the dignity of women;
(f)  to value and preserve the rich heritage of the country’s composite
culture;
(g)  to protect and improve the natural environment including forests,
lakes, rivers and wildlife and to have compassion for living creatures;
(h)  to develop scientific temper, humanism and the spirit of inquiry
and reform;
(i)  to safeguard public property and to abjure violence;
(j)  to strive towards excellence in all spheres of individual and
collective activity so that the nation constantly rises to higher levels of
endeavour and achievement; and
(k)  to provide opportunities for education to his child or ward between
the age of six and fourteen years. This duty was added by the 86th
Constitutional Amendment Act, 2002.
FEATURES OF THE FUNDAMENTAL DUTIES
Following points can be noted with regard to the characteristics of the
Fundamental Duties:
1.  Some of them are moral duties while others are civic duties. For
instance, cherishing noble ideals of freedom struggle is a moral precept
and respecting the Constitution, National Flag and National Anthem is
a civic duty.
2.  They refer to such values which have been a part of the Indian
tradition, mythology, religions and practices. In other words, they
essentially contain just a codification of tasks integral to the Indian
way of life.
3.  Unlike some of the Fundamental Rights which extend to all persons
whether citizens or foreigners1
, the Fundamental Duties are confined
to citizens only and do not extend to foreigners.
4.  Like the Directive Principles, the fundamental duties are also nonjusticiable. The Constitution does not provide for their direct
enforcement by the courts. Moreover, there is not legal sanction
against their violation. However, the Parliament is free to enforce them
by suitable legislation.
CRITICISM OF FUNDAMENTAL DUTIES
The Fundamental Duties mentioned in Part IVA of the Constitution have
been criticised on the following grounds:
1.  The list of duties is not exhaustive as it does not cover other
important duties like casting vote, paying taxes, family planning and
so on. In fact, duty to pay taxes was recommended by the Swaran
Singh Committee.
2.  Some of the duties are vague, ambiguous and difficult to be
understood by the common man. For example, different interpretations
can be given to the phrases like ‘noble ideals’, ‘composite culture’,
‘scientific temper’ and so on2
 .
3.  They have been described by the critics as a code of moral precepts
due to their non-justiciable character. Interestingly, the Swaran Singh
Committee had suggested for penalty or punishment for the nonperformance of Fundamental Duties.
4.  Their inclusion in the Constitution was described by the critics as
superfluous. This is because the duties included in the Constitution as
fundamental would be performed by the people even though they were
not incorporated in the Constitution3
 .
5.  The critics said that the inclusion of fundamental duties as an
appendage to Part IV of the Constitution has reduced their value and
significance. They should have been added after Part III so as to keep
them on par with Fundamental Rights.
SIGNIFICANCE OF FUNDAMENTAL DUTIES
In spite of criticisms and opposition, the fundamental duties are considered
significant from the following viewpoints:
1.  They serve as a reminder to the citizens that while enjoying their
rights, they should also be conscious of duties they owe to their
country, their society and to their fellow citizens.
2.  They serve as a warning against the antinational and antisocial
activities like burning the national flag, destroying public property and
so on.
3.  They serve as a source of inspiration for the citizens and promote a
sense of discipline and commitment among them. They create a feeling
that the citizens are not mere spectators but active participants in the
realisation of national goals.
4.  They help the courts in examining and determining the
constitutional validity of a law. In 1992, the Supreme Court ruled that
in determining the constitutionality of any law, if a court finds that the
law in question seeks to give effect to a fundamental duty, it may
consider such law to be ‘reasonable’ in relation to Article 14 (equality
before law) or Article 19 (six freedoms) and thus save such law from
unconstitutionality.
5.  They are enforceable by law. Hence, the Parliament can provide for
the imposition of appropriate penalty or punishment for failure to fulfil
any of them.
H.R. Gokhale, the then Law Minister, gave the following reason for
incorporating the fundamental duties in the Constitution after twenty-six
years of its inauguration: ‘In post-independent India, particularly on the eve
of emergency in June 1975, a section of the people showed no anxiety to
fulfil their fundamental obligations of respecting the established legal order
..... the provisions of chapter on fundamental duties would have a sobering
effect on these restless spirits who have had a host of anti-national
subversive and unconstitutional agitations in the past’.
Indira Gandhi, the then Prime Minister, justified the inclusion of
fundamental duties in the Constitution and argued that their inclusion would
help to strengthen democracy. She said, ‘the moral value of fundamental
duties would be not to smoother rights but to establish a democratic balance
by making the people conscious of their duties equally as they are
conscious of their rights’.
The Opposition in the Parliament strongly opposed the inclusion of
fundamental duties in the Constitution by the Congress government.
However, the new Janata Government headed by Morarji Desai in the postemergency period did not annul the Fundamental Duties. Notably, the new
government sought to undo many changes introduced in the Constitution by
the 42nd Amendment Act (1976) through the 43rd Amendment Act (1977)
and the 44th Amendment Act (1978). This shows that there was an eventual
consensus on the necessity and desirability of including the Fundamental
Duties in the Constitution. This is more clear with the addition of one more
Fundamental Duty in 2002 by the 86th Amendment Act.
VERMA COMMITTEE OBSERVATIONS
The Verma Committee on Fundamental Duties of the Citizens (1999)
identified the existence of legal provisions for the implementation of some
of the Fundamental Duties. They are mentioned below:
1.  The Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act (1971) prevents
disrespect to the Constitution of India, the National Flag and the
National Anthem.
2.  The various criminal laws in force provide for punishments for
encouraging enmity between different sections of people on grounds of
language, race, place of birth, religion and so on.
3.  The Protection of Civil Rights Act4
(1955) provides for
punishments for offences related to caste and religion.
4.  The Indian Penal Code (IPC) declares the imputations and
assertions prejudicial to national integration as punishable offences.
5.  The Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act of 1967 provides for the
declaration of a communal organisation as an unlawful association.
6.  The Representation of People Act (1951) provides for the
disqualification of members of the Parliament or a state legislature for
indulging in corrupt practice, that is, soliciting votes on the ground of
religion or promoting enmity between different sections of people on
grounds of caste, race, language, religion and so on.
7.  The Wildlife (Protection) Act of 1972 prohibits trade in rare and
endangered species.
8.  The Forest (Conservation) Act of 1980 checks indiscriminate
deforestation and diversion of forest land for nonforest purposes.
NOTES AND REFERENCES
1.  The Fundamental Rights guaranteed by Articles 14, 20, 21, 21A,
22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27 and 28 are available to all persons whether
citizens or foreigners.
2.  D.D. Chawla, the then president of the National Forum of Lawyers
and Legal Aid, Delhi, observed: ‘The duties may be spelt out in a more
concrete form, one is left guessing the noble ideals. To some even the
Bhagat Singh cult may be such an ideal as inspired our national
struggle. Again what is the rich heritage of our composite culture and
what is scientific temper, humanism and the spirit of inquiry and
reform? The values are beyond the ken of the general run of the people
and carry no meaning to them. Duties should be such and so worded as
to catch the imagination of the common man.’
D.D. Chawla, ‘The Concept of Fundamental Duties’, Socialist India
(New Delhi), October 23, 1976, P. 44–45.
3.  C.K. Daphtary, former Attorney General of India, while opposing
the inclusion of fundamental duties in the Constitution, said that more
than 99.9 per cent of the citizens were law-abiding and there was no
need to tell them about their duties. He argued that as long as the
people are satisfied and contended, they willingly perform their duties.
He said, ‘To tell them what their duties are implies that they are not
content. If that is the case after 26 years, it is not their fault’. A.K. Sen
also opposed the inclusion of fundamental duties in the Constitution
and remarked, ‘A democratic set-up, instead of thriving on the willing
cooperation and confidence of people, is reduced to the position of a
harsh school master asking the student to stand up on the class room
bench because he has not done the home work. To begin with, it were
the people of India who created the Sovereign Democratic Republic of
India in 1950, but the Republic is now claiming to be the master of the
citizens enjoining habitual obedience to its command to do his duty.
The state’s confidence in the citizens is obviously shaken’.
4.  This Act was known as the Untouchability (Offences) Act till 1976.
10 Amendment of the Constitution
Like any other written Constitution, the Constitution of India also provides
for its amendment in order to adjust itself to the changing conditions and
needs. However, the procedure laid down for its amendment is neither as
easy as in Britain nor as difficult as in USA. In other words, the Indian
Constitution is neither flexible nor rigid but a synthesis of both.
Article 368 in Part XX of the Constitution deals with the powers of
Parliament to amend the Constitution and its procedure. It states that the
Parliament may, in exercise of its constituent power, amend by way of
addition, variation or repeal any provision of the Constitution in accordance
with the procedure laid down for the purpose. However, the Parliament
cannot amend those provisions which form the ‘basic structure’ of the
Constitution. This was ruled by the Supreme Court in the Kesavananda
Bharati case1
 (1973).
PROCEDURE FOR AMENDMENT
The procedure for the amendment of the Constitution as laid down in
Article 368 is as follows:
1.  An amendment of the Constitution can be initiated only by the
introduction of a bill for the purpose in either House of Parliament and
not in the state legislatures.
2.  The bill can be introduced either by a minister or by a private
member and does not require prior permission of the president.
3.  The bill must be passed in each House by a special majority, that is,
a majority of the total membership of the House and a majority of twothirds of the members of the House present and voting.
4.  Each House must pass the bill separately. In case of a disagreement
between the two Houses, there is no provision for holding a joint
sitting of the two Houses for the purpose of deliberation and passage
of the bill.
5.  If the bill seeks to amend the federal provisions of the Constitution,
it must also be ratified by the legislatures of half of the states by a
simple majority, that is, a majority of the members of the House
present and voting.
6.  After duly passed by both the Houses of Parliament and ratified by
the state legislatures, where necessary, the bill is presented to the
president for assent.
7.  The president must give his assent to the bill. He can neither
withhold his assent to the bill nor return the bill for reconsideration of
the Parliament.2
8.  After the president’s assent, the bill becomes an Act (i.e., a
constitutional amendment act) and the Constitution stands amended in
accordance with the terms of the Act.
TYPES OF AMENDMENTS
Article 368 provides for two types of amendments, that is, by a special
majority of Parliament and also through the ratification of half of the states
by a simple majority. But, some other articles provide for the amendment of
certain provisions of the Constitution by a simple majority of Parliament,
that is, a majority of the members of each House present and voting (similar
to the ordinary legislative process). Notably, these amendments are not
deemed to be amendments of the Constitution for the purposes of Article
368.
Therefore, the Constitution can be amended in three ways:
(a)  Amendment by simple majority of the Parliament,
(b)  Amendment by special majority of the Parliament, and
(c)  Amendment by special majority of the Parliament and the
ratification of half of the state legislatures.
By Simple Majority of Parliament
A number of provisions in the Constitution can be amended by a simple
majority of the two Houses of Parliament outside the scope of Article 368.
These provisions include:
1.  Admission or establishment of new states.
2.  Formation of new states and alteration of areas, boundaries or
names of existing states.
3.  Abolition or creation of legislative councils in states.
4.  Second Schedule–emoluments, allowances, privileges and so on of
the president, the governors, the Speakers, judges, etc.
5.  Quorum in Parliament.
6.  Salaries and allowances of the members of Parliament.
7.  Rules of procedure in Parliament.
8.  Privileges of the Parliament, its members and its committees.
9.  Use of English language in Parliament.
10.  Number of puisne judges in the Supreme Court.
11.  Conferment of more jurisdiction on the Supreme Court.
12.  Use of official language.
13.  Citizenship–acquisition and termination.
14.  Elections to Parliament and state legislatures.
15.  Delimitation of constituencies.
16.  Union territories.
17.  Fifth Schedule–administration of scheduled areas and scheduled
tribes.
18.  Sixth Schedule–administration of tribal areas.
By Special Majority of Parliament
The majority of the provisions in the Constitution need to be amended by a
special majority of the Parliament, that is, a majority of the total
membership of each House and a majority of two-thirds of the members of
each House present and voting. The expression ‘total membership’ means
the total number of members comprising the House irrespective of fact
whether there are vacancies or absentees.
‘Strictly speaking, the special majority is required only for voting at the
third reading stage of the bill but by way of abundant caution the
requirement for special majority has been provided for in the rules of the
Houses in respect of all the effective stages of the bill’3
 .
The provisions which can be amended by this way includes: (i)
Fundamental Rights; (ii) Directive Principles of State Policy; and (iii) All
other provisions which are not covered by the first and third categories.
By Special Majority of Parliament and Consent of States
Those provisions of the Constitution which are related to the federal
structure of the polity can be amended by a special majority of the
Parliament and also with the consent of half of the state legislatures by a
simple majority. If one or some or all the remaining states take no action on
the bill, it does not matter; the moment half of the states give their consent,
the formality is completed. There is no time limit within which the states
should give their consent to the bill.
The following provisions can be amended in this way:
1.  Election of the President and its manner.
2.  Extent of the executive power of the Union and the states.
3.  Supreme Court and high courts.
4.  Distribution of legislative powers between the Union and the states.
5.  Goods and Services Tax Council3a
.
6.  Any of the lists in the Seventh Schedule.
7.  Representation of states in Parliament.
8.  Power of Parliament to amend the Constitution and its procedure
(Article 368 itself).
CRITICISM OF THE AMENDMENT PROCEDURE
Critics have criticised the amendment procedure of the Constitution on the
following grounds:
1.  There is no provision for a special body like Constitutional
Convention (as in USA) or Constitutional Assembly for amending the
Constitution. The constituent power is vested in the Parliament and
only in few cases, in the state legislatures.
2.  The power to initiate an amendment to the Constitution lies with
the Parliament. Hence, unlike in USA4
, the state legislatures cannot
initiate any bill or proposal for amending the Constitution except in
one case, that is, passing a resolution requesting the Parliament for the
creation or abolition of legislative councils in the states. Here also, the
Parliament can either approve or disapprove such a resolution or may
not take any action on it.
3.  Major part of the Constitution can be amended by the Parliament
alone either by a special majority or by a simple majority. Only in few
cases, the consent of the state legislatures is required and that too, only
half of them, while in USA, it is three-fourths of the states.
4.  The Constitution does not prescribe the time frame within which
the state legislatures should ratify or reject an amendment submitted to
them. Also, it is silent on the issue whether the states can withdraw
their approval after according the same.
5.  There is no provision for holding a joint sitting of both the Houses
of Parliament if there is a deadlock over the passage of a constitutional
amendment bill. On the other hand, a provision for a joint sitting is
made in the case of an ordinary bill.
6.  The process of amendment is similar to that of a legislative process.
Except for the special majority, the constitutional amendment bills are
to be passed by the Parliament in the same way as ordinary bills.
7.  The provisions relating to the amendment procedure are too
sketchy. Hence, they leave a wide scope for taking the matters to the
judiciary.
Despite these defects, it cannot be denied that the process has proved to
be simple and easy and has succeeded in meeting the changed needs and
conditions. The procedure is not so flexible as to allow the ruling parties to
change it according to their whims. Nor is it so rigid as to be incapable of
adopting itself to the changing needs. It, as rightly said by K.C. Wheare,
‘strikes a good balance between flexibility and rigidity’5
. In this context,
Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru said in the Constituent Assembly, ‘While we want
this Constitution to be as solid and permanent as we can make it, there is no
permanence in a Constitution. There should be a certain flexibility. If you
make any Constitution rigid and permanent, you stop the nation’s growth,
the growth of a living, vital, organic people’6
 .
Similarly, Dr. B.R. Ambedkar observed in the Constituent Assembly that,
‘The Assembly has not only refrained from putting a seal of finality and
infallibility upon this Constitution by denying the people the right to amend
the Constitution as in Canada or by making the amendment of the
Constitution subject to the fulfilment of extraordinary terms and conditions
as in America or Australia, but has provided for a facile procedure for
amending the Constitution’7
 .
K.C. Wheare has admired the variety of amendment procedures
contained in the Constitution of India. He said, ‘this variety in the amending
process is wise but rarely found’. According to Granville Austin, ‘the
amending process has proved itself one of the most ably conceived aspects
of the Constitution. Although it appears complicated, it is merely diverse’.8

11 Basic Structure of the Constitution
EMERGENCE OF THE BASIC STRUCTURE
The question whether Fundamental Rights can be amended by the
Parliament under Article 368 came for consideration of the Supreme Court
within a year of the Constitution coming into force. In the Shankari Prasad
case1
(1951), the constitutional validity of the First Amendment Act (1951),
which curtailed the right to property, was challenged. The Supreme Court
ruled that the power of the Parliament to amend the Constitution under
Article 368 also includes the power to amend Fundamental Rights. The
word ‘law’ in Article 13 includes only ordinary laws and not the
constitutional amendment acts (constituent laws). Therefore, the Parliament
can abridge or take away any of the Fundamental Rights by enacting a
constitutional amendment act and such a law will not be void under Article
13.
But in the Golak Nath case2
(1967), the Supreme Court reversed its
earlier stand. In that case, the constitutional validity of the Seventeenth
Amendment Act (1964), which inserted certain state acts in the Ninth
Schedule, was challenged. The Supreme Court ruled that the Fundamental
Rights are given a ‘transcendental and immutable’ position and hence, the
Parliament cannot abridge or take away any of these rights. A constitutional
amendment act is also a law within the meaning of Article 13 and hence,
would be void for violating any of the Fundamental Rights.
The Parliament reacted to the Supreme Court’s judgement in the Golak
Nath case (1967) by enacting the 24th Amendment Act (1971). This Act
amended Articles 13 and 368.
It declared that the Parliament has the power to abridge or take away any
of the Fundamental Rights under Article 368 and such an act will not be a
law under the meaning of Article 13.
However, in the Kesavananda Bharati case3
(1973), the Supreme Court
overruled its judgement in the Golak Nath case (1967). It upheld the
validity of the 24th Amendment Act (1971) and stated that Parliament is
empowered to abridge or take away any of the Fundamental Rights. At the
same time, it laid down a new doctrine of the ‘basic structure’ (or ‘basic
features’) of the Constitution. It ruled that the constituent power of
Parliament under Article 368 does not enable it to alter the ‘basic structure’
of the Constitution. This means that the Parliament cannot abridge or take
away a Fundamental Right that forms a part of the ‘basic structure’ of the
Constitution.
The doctrine of basic structure of the constitution was reaffirmed and
applied by the Supreme Court in the Indira Nehru Gandhi case3a
(1975). In
this case, the Supreme Court invalidated a provision of the 39th Amendment
Act (1975) which kept the election disputes involving the Prime Minister
and the Speaker of Lok Sabha outside the jurisdiction of all courts. The
court said that this provision was beyond the amending power of Parliament
as it affected the basic structure of the constitution.
Again, the Parliament reacted to this judicially innovated doctrine of
‘basic structure’ by enacting the 42nd Amendment Act (1976). This Act
amended Article 368 and declared that there is no limitation on the
constituent power of Parliament and no amendment can be questioned in
any court on any ground including that of the contravention of any of the
Fundamental Rights.
However, the Supreme Court in the Minerva Mills case4
(1980)
invalidated this provision as it excluded judicial review which is a ‘basic
feature’ of the Constitution. Applying the doctrine of ‘basic structure’ with
respect to Article 368, the court held that:
“Since the Constitution had conferred a limited amending power on the
Parliament, the Parliament cannot under the exercise of that limited power
enlarge that very power into an absolute power. Indeed, a limited amending
power is one of the basic features of the Constitution and, therefore, the
limitations on that power cannot be destroyed. In other words, Parliament
cannot, under article 368, expand its amending power so as to acquire for
itself the right to repeal or abrogate the Constitution or to destroy its basic
features. The donee of a limited power cannot by the exercise of that power
convert the limited power into an unlimited one”.
Again in the Waman Rao case5
(1981), the Supreme Court adhered to the
doctrine of the ‘basic structure’ and further clarified that it would apply to
constitutional amendments enacted after April 24, 1973 (i.e., the date of the
judgement in the Kesavananda Bharati case).
ELEMENTS OF THE BASIC STRUCTURE
The present position is that the Parliament under Article 368 can amend any
part of the Constitution including the Fundamental Rights but without
affecting the ‘basic structure’ of the Constitution. However, the Supreme
Court is yet to define or clarify as to what constitutes the ‘basic structure’ of
the Constitution. From the various judgements, the following have emerged
as ‘basic features’ of the Constitution or elements of the ‘basic structure’ of
the constitution:
1.  Supremacy of the Constitution
2.  Sovereign, democratic and republican nature of the Indian polity
3.  Secular character of the Constitution
4.  Separation of powers between the legislature, the executive and the
judiciary
5.  Federal character of the Constitution

SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT

12 Parliamentary System
The Constitution of India provides for a parliamentary form of
government, both at the Centre and in the states. Articles 74 and 75 deal
with the parliamentary system at the Centre and Articles 163 and 164 in the
states.
Modern democratic governments are classified into parliamentary and
presidential on the basis of nature of relations between the executive and
the legislative organs of the government. The parliamentary system of
government is the one in which the executive is responsible to the
legislature for its policies and acts. The presidential system of government,
on the other hand, is one in which the executive is not responsible to the
legislature for its policies and acts, and is constitutionally independent of
the legislature in respect of its term of office.
The parliamentary government is also known as cabinet government or
responsible government or Westminster model of government and is
prevalent in Britain, Japan, Canada, India among others. The presidential
government, on the other hand, is also known as non-responsible or nonparliamentary or fixed executive system of government and is prevalent in
USA, Brazil, Russia, Sri Lanka among others.
Ivor Jennings called the parliamentary system as ‘cabinet system’
because the cabinet is the nucleus of power in a parliamentary system. The
parliamentary government is also known as ‘responsible government’ as the
cabinet (the real executive) is accountable to the Parliament and stays in
office so long as it enjoys the latter’s confidence. It is described as
‘Westminster model of government’ after the location of the British
Parliament, where the parliamentary system originated.
In the past, the British constitutional and political experts described the
Prime Minister as ‘primus inter pares’ (first among equals) in relation to the
cabinet. In the recent period, the Prime Minister’s power, influence and
position have increased significantly vis-a-vis the cabinet. He has come to
play a ‘dominant’ role in the British politico-administrative system. Hence,
the later political analysts, like Cross-man, Mackintosh and others have
described the British system of government as ‘prime ministerial
government’. The same description holds good in the Indian context too.
FEATURES OF PARLIAMENTARY GOVERNMENT
The features or principles of parliamentary government in India are:
1. Nominal and Real Executives
The President is the nominal executive (de jure executive or titular
executive) while the Prime Minister is the real executive (de facto
executive). Thus, the President is head of the State, while the Prime
Minister is head of the government. Article 74 provides for a council of
ministers headed by the Prime Minister to aid and advise the President in
the exercise of his functions. The advice so tendered is binding on the
President1
 .
2. Majority Party Rule
The political party which secures majority seats in the Lok Sabha forms the
government. The leader of that party is appointed as the Prime Minister by
the President; other ministers are appointed by the President on the advice
of the prime minister. However, when no single party gets the majority, a
coalition of parties may be invited by the President to form the government.
3. Collective Responsibility
This is the bedrock principle of parliamentary government. The ministers
are collectively responsible to the Parliament in general and to the Lok
Sabha in particular (Article 75). They act as a team, and swim and sink
together. The principle of collective responsibility implies that the Lok
Sabha can remove the ministry (i.e., council of ministers headed by the
prime minister) from office by passing a vote of no confidence.
4. Political Homogeneity
Usually members of the council of ministers belong to the same political
party, and hence they share the same political ideology. In case of coalition
government, the ministers are bound by consensus.
5. Double Membership
The ministers are members of both the legislature and the executive. This
means that a person cannot be a minister without being a member of the
Parliament. The Constitution stipulates that a minister who is not a member
of the Parliament for a period of six consecutive months ceases to be a
minister.
6. Leadership of the Prime Minister
The Prime Minister plays the leadership role in this system of government.
He is the leader of council of ministers, leader of the Parliament and leader
of the party in power. In these capacities, he plays a significant and highly
crucial role in the functioning of the government.
7. Dissolution of the Lower House
The lower house of the Parliament (Lok Sabha) can be dissolved by the
President on recommendation of the Prime Minister. In other words, the
prime minister can advise the President to dissolve the Lok Sabha before
the expiry of its term and hold fresh elections. This means that the
executive enjoys the right to get the legislature dissolved in a parliamentary
system.
8. Secrecy
The ministers operate on the principle of secrecy of procedure and cannot
divulge information about their proceedings, policies and decisions. They
take the oath of secrecy before entering their office. The oath of secrecy to
the ministers is administered by the President.
FEATURES OF PRESIDENTIAL GOVERNMENT
Unlike the Indian Constitution, the American Constitution provides for the
presidential form of government. The features of the American presidential
system of government are as follows:
(a)  The American President is both the head of the State and the head
of government. As the head of State, he occupies a ceremonial
position. As the head of government, he leads the executive organ of
government.
(b)  The President is elected by an electoral college for a fixed tenure
of four years. He cannot be removed by the Congress except by
impeachment for a grave unconstitutional act.
(c)  The President governs with the help of a cabinet or a smaller body
called ‘Kitchen Cabinet’. It is only an advisory body and consists of
non-elected departmental secretaries. They are selected and appointed
by him, are responsible only to him, and can be removed by him any
time.
(d)  The President and his secretaries are not responsible to the
Congress for their acts. They neither possess membership in the
Congress nor attend its sessions.
(e)  The President cannot dissolve the House of Representatives–the
lower house of the Congress.
(f)  The doctrine of separation of powers is the basis of the American
presidential system. The legislative, executive and judicial powers of
the government are separated and vested in the three independent
organs of the government.
MERITS OF THE PARLIAMENTARY SYSTEM
The parliamentary system of government has the following merits:
1. Harmony Between Legislature and Executive
The greatest advantage of the parliamentary system is that it ensures
harmonious relationship and cooperation between the legislative and
executive organs of the government. The executive is a part of the
legislature and both are interdependent at work. As a result, there is less
scope for disputes and conflicts between the two organs.
2. Responsible Government
By its very nature, the parliamentary system establishes a responsible
government. The ministers are responsible to the Parliament for all their
acts of omission and commission. The Parliament exercises control over the
ministers through various devices like question hour, discussions,
adjournment motion, no confidence motion, etc.
3. Prevents Despotism
Under this system, the executive authority is vested in a group of
individuals (council of ministers) and not in a single person. This dispersal
of authority checks the dictatorial tendencies of the executive. Moreover,
the executive is responsible to the Parliament and can be removed by a noconfidence motion.
4. Ready Alternative Government
In case the ruling party loses its majority, the Head of the State can invite
the opposition party to form the government. This means an alternative
government can be formed without fresh elections. Hence, Dr. Jennings
says, ‘the leader of the opposition is the alternative prime minister’.
5. Wide Representation
In a parliamentary system, the executive consists of a group of individuals
(i.e., ministers who are representatives of the people). Hence, it is possible
to provide representation to all sections and regions in the government. The
prime minister while selecting his ministers can take this factor into
consideration.
DEMERITS OF THE PARLIAMENTARY SYSTEM
In spite of the above merits, the parliamentary system suffers from the
following demerits:
1. Unstable Government
The parliamentary system does not provide a stable government. There is
no guarantee that a government can survive its tenure. The ministers depend
on the mercy of the majority legislators for their continuity and survival in
office. A no-confidence motion or political defection or evils of multiparty
coalition can make the government unstable. The Government headed by
Morarji Desai, Charan Singh, V.P. Singh, Chandra Sekhar, Deva Gowda and
I.K. Gujral are some such examples.
2. No Continuity of Policies
The parliamentary system is not conductive for the formulation and
implementation of longterm policies. This is due to the uncertainty of the
tenure of the government. A change in the ruling party is usually followed
by changes in the policies of the government. For example, the Janata
Government headed by Morarji Desai in 1977 reversed a large number of
policies of the previous Congress Government. The same was repeated by
the Congress government after it came back to power in 1980.
3. Dictatorship of the Cabinet
When the ruling party enjoys absolute majority in the Parliament, the
cabinet becomes autocratic and exercises nearly unlimited powers. H.J.
Laski says that the parliamentary system gives the executive an opportunity
for tyranny. Ramsay Muir, the former British Prime Minister, also
complained of the ‘dictatorship of the cabinet’2
. This phenomena was
witnessed during the era of Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi.
4. Against Separation of Powers
In the parliamentary system, the legislature and the executive are together
and inseparable. The cabinet acts as the leader of legislature as well as the
executive. As Bagehot points out, ‘the cabinet is a hyphen that joins the
buckle that binds the executive and legislative departments together.’
Hence, the whole system of government goes against the letter and spirit of
the theory of separation of powers3
. In fact, there is a fusion of powers.
5. Government by Amateurs
The parliamentary system is not conducive to administrative efficiency as
the ministers are not experts in their fields. The Prime Minister has a
limited choice in the selection of ministers; his choice is restricted to the
members of Parliament alone and does not extend to external talent.
Moreover, the ministers devote most of their time to parliamentary work,
cabinet meetings and party activities.
Now, let us compare the parliamentary and presidential systems in terms
of their features, merits and demerits.
REASONS FOR ADOPTING PARLIAMENTARY
SYSTEM
A plea was made in favour of US presidential system of government in the
Constituent Assembly4
. But, the founding fathers preferred the British
parliamentary system due to the following reasons:

3.  Based on separation of powers.
4.   Government by experts
1. Familiarity with the System
The Constitution-makers were somewhat familiar with the parliamentary
system as it had been in operation in India during the British rule. K.M.
Munshi argued that, ‘For the last thirty or forty years, some kind of
responsibility has been introduced in the governance of this country. Our
constitutional traditions have become Parliamentary. After this experience,
why should we go back and buy a novel experience.’5
2. Preference to More Responsibility
Dr. B.R. Ambedkar pointed out in the Constituent Assembly that ‘a
democratic executive must satisfy two conditions: stability and
responsibility. Unfortunately, it has not been possible so far to devise a
system which can ensure both in equal degree. The American system gives
more stability but less responsibility. The British system, on the other hand,
gives more responsibility but less stability. The Draft Constitution in
recommending the parliamentary system of Executive has preferred more
responsibility to more stability.’6
3. Need to Avoid Legislative–Executive Conflicts
The framers of the Constitution wanted to avoid the conflicts between the
legislature and the executive which are bound to occur in the presidential
system prevalent in USA. They thought that an infant democracy could not
afford to take the risk of a perpetual cleavage, feud or conflict or threatened
conflict between these two organs of the government. They wanted a form
of government that would be conductive to the manifold development of the
country.
4. Nature of Indian Society
India is one of the most heterogeneous States and most complex plural
societies in the world. Hence, the Constitution-makers adopted the
parliamentary system as it offers greater scope for giving representation to
various section, interests and regions in the government. This promotes a
national spirit among the people and builds a united India.
Whether the parliamentary system should be continued or should be
replaced by the presidential system has been a point of discussion and
debate in our country since the 1970s. This matter was considered in detail
by the Swaran Singh Committee appointed by the Congress government in
1975. The committee opined that the parliamentary system has been doing
well and hence, there is no need to replace it by the presidential system.
DISTINCTION BETWEEN INDIAN AND BRITISH
MODELS
The parliamentary system of government in India is largely based on the
British parliamentary system. However, it never became a replica of the
British system and differs in the following respects:
1.  India has a republican system in place of British monarchical
system. In other words, the Head of the State in India (that is,
President) is elected, while the Head of the State in Britain (that is,
King or Queen) enjoys a hereditary position.
2.  The British system is based on the doctrine of the sovereignty of
Parliament, while the Parliament is not supreme in India and enjoys
limited and restricted powers due to a written Constitution, federal
system, judicial review and fundamental rights7
 .
3.  In Britain, the prime minister should be a member of the Lower
House (House of Commons) of the Parliament. In India, the prime
minister may be a member of any of the two Houses of Parliament.8
4.  Usually, the members of Parliament alone are appointed as
ministers in Britain. In India, a person who is not a member of
Parliament can also be appointed as minister, but for a maximum
period of six months.
5.  Britain has the system of legal responsibility of the minister while
India has no such system. Unlike in Britain, the ministers in India are
not required to countersign the official acts of the Head of the State.
6.  ‘Shadow cabinet’ is an unique institution of the British cabinet
system. It is formed by the opposition party to balance the ruling
cabinet and to prepare its members for future ministerial office. There
is no such institution in India.

Rajya Sabha.
13 Federal System
Political scientists have classified governments into unitary and federal on
the basis of the nature of relations between the national government and the
regional governments. By definition, a unitary government is one in which
all the powers are vested in the national government and the regional
governments, if at all exist, derive their authority from the national
government. A federal government, on the other hand, is one in which
powers are divided between the national government and the regional
governments by the Constitution itself and both operate in their respective
jurisdictions independently. Britain, France, Japan, China, Italy, Belgium,
Norway, Sweden, Spain and so on have the unitary model of government
while the US, Switzerland, Australia, Canada, Russia, Brazil, Argentina and
so on have the federal model of government. In a federal model, the
national government is known as the Federal government or the Central
government or the Union government and the regional government is
known as the state government or the provincial government.
The specific features of the federal and unitary governments are
mentioned below in a comparative manner:
The term ‘federation’ is drived from a Latin word foedus which means
‘treaty’ or ‘agreement’. Thus, a federation is a new state (political system)
which is formed through a treaty or an agreement between the various units.
The units of a federation are known by various names like states (as in US)
or cantons (as in Switzerland) or provinces (as in Canada) or republics (as
in Russia).

A federation can be formed in two ways, that is, by way of integration or
by way of disintegration. In the first case, a number of militarily weak or
economically backward states (independent) come together to form a big
and a strong union, as for example, the US. In the second case, a big unitary
state is converted into a federation by granting autonomy to the provinces to
promote regional interest (for example, Canada). The US is the first and the
oldest federation in the world. It was formed in 1787 following the
American Revolution (1775–83). It comprises 50 states (originally 13
states) and is taken as the model of federation. The Canadian Federation,
comprising 10 provinces (originally 4 provinces) is also quite old–formed
in 1867.
The Constitution of India provides for a federal system of government in
the country. The framers adopted the federal system due to two main
reasons–the large size of the country and its socio-cultural diversity. They
realised that the federal system not only ensures the efficient governance of
the country but also reconciles national unity with regional autonomy.
However, the term ‘federation’ has no where been used in the
Constitution. Instead, Article 1 of the Constitution describes India asa
‘Union of States’. According to Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, the phrase ‘Union of
States’ has been preferred to ‘Federation of States’ to indicate two things:
(i) the Indian federation is not the result of an agreement among the states
like the American federation; and (ii) the states have no right to secede from
the federation. The federation is union because it is indestructible.1
The Indian federal system is based on the ‘Canadian model’ and not on
the ‘American model’. The ‘Canadian model’ differs fundamentally from
the ‘American model’ in so far as it establishes a very strong centre. The
Indian federation resembles the Candian federation (i) in its formation (i.e.,
by way of disintegration); (ii) in its preference to the term ‘Union’ (the
Canadian federation is also called a ‘Union’); and (iii) in its centralising
tendency (i.e., vesting more powers in the centre vis-a-vis the states).
FEDERAL FEATURES OF THE CONSTITUTION
The federal features of the Constitution of India are explained below:
1. Dual Polity
The Constitution establishes a dual polity consisting the Union at the Centre
and the states at the periphery. Each is endowed with sovereign powers to
be exercised in the field assigned to them respectively by the Constitution.
The Union government deals with the matters of national importance like
defence, foreign affairs, currency, communication and so on. The state
governments, on the other hand, look after the matters of regional and local
importance like public order, agriculture, health, local government and so
on.
2. Written Constitution
The Constitution is not only a written document but also the lengthiest
Constitution of the world. Originally, it contained a Preamble, 395 Articles
(divided into 22 Parts) and 8 Schedules.2 At present (2019), it consists of a
Preamble, about 470 Articles (divided into 25 Parts) and 12 Schedules.3
It
specifies the structure, organisation, powers and functions of both the
Central and state governments and prescribes the limits within which they
must operate. Thus, it avoids the misunderstandings and disagreements
between the two.
3. Division of Powers
The Constitution divided the powers between the Centre and the states in
terms of the Union List, State List and Concurrent List in the Seventh
Schedule. The Union List consists of 98 subjects (originally 97), the State
List 59 subjects (originally 66) and the Concurrent List 52 subjects
(originally 47). Both the Centre and the states can make laws on the
subjects of the concurrent list, but in case of a conflict, the Central law
prevails. The residuary subjects (ie, which are not mentioned in any of the
three lists) are given to the Centre.
4. Supremacy of the Constitution
The Constitution is the supreme (or the highest) law of the land. The laws
enacted by the Centre and the states must conform to its provisions.
Otherwise, they can be declared invalid by the Supreme Court or the high
courts through their power of judicial review. Thus, the organs of the
government (legislative, executive and judicial) at both the levels must
operate within the jurisdiction prescribed by the Constitution.
5. Rigid Constitution
The division of powers established by the Constitution as well as the
supremacy of the Constitution can be maintained only if the method of its
amendment is rigid. Hence, the Constitution is rigid to the extent that those
provisions which are concerned with the federal structure (i.e., Centre-state
relations and judicial organisation) can be amended only by the joint action
of the Central and state governments. Such provisions require for their
amendment a special majority4 of the Parliament and also an approval of
half of the state legislatures.
6. Independent Judiciary
The Constitution establishes an independent judiciary headed by the
Supreme Court for two purposes: one, to protect the supremacy of the
Constitution by exercising the power of judicial review; and two, to settle
the disputes between the Centre and the states or between the states. The
Constitution contains various measures like security of tenure to judges,
fixed service conditions and so on to make the judiciary independent of the
government.
7. Bicameralism
The Constitution provides for a bicameral legislature consisting of an Upper
House (Rajya Sabha) and a Lower House (Lok Sabha). The Rajya Sabha
represents the states of Indian Federation, while the Lok Sabha represents
the people of India as a whole. The Rajya Sabha (even though a less
powerful chamber) is required to maintain the federal equilibrium by
protecting the interests of the states against the undue interference of the
Centre.
UNITARY FEATURES OF THE CONSTITUTION
Besides the above federal features, the Indian Constitution also possesses
the following unitary or non-federal features:
1. Strong Centre
The division of powers is in favour of the Centre and highly inequitable
from the federal angle. Firstly, the Union List contains more subjects than
the State List. Secondly, the more important subjects have been included in
the Union List. Thirdly, the Centre has overriding authority over the
Concurrent List. Finally, the residuary powers have also been left with the
Centre, while in the US, they are vested in the states. Thus, the Constitution
has made the Centre very strong.
2. States Not Indestructible
Unlike in other federations, the states in India have no right to territorial
integrity. The Parliament can by unilateral action change the area,
boundaries or name of any state. Moreover, it requires only a simple
majority and not a special majority. Hence, the Indian Federation is “an
indestructible Union of destructible states”. The American Federation, on
the other hand, is described as “an indestructible Union of indestructible
states”.
3. Single Constitution
Usually, in a federation, the states have the right to frame their own
Constitution separate from that of the Centre. In India, on the contrary, no
such power is given to the states. The Constitution of India embodies not
only the Constitution of the Centre but also those of the states. Both the
Centre and the states must operate within this single-frame. The only
exception in this regard was the case of Jammu and Kashmir which had its
own (state) Constitution.5
4. Flexibility of the Constitution
The process of constitutional amendment is less rigid than what is found in
other federations. The bulk of the Constitution can be amended by the
unilateral action of the Parliament, either by simple majority or by special
majority. Further, the power to initiate an amendment to the Constitution
lies only with the Centre. In US, the states can also propose an amendment
to the Constitution.
5. No Equality of State Representation
The states are given representation in the Rajya Sabha on the basis of
population. Hence, the membership varies from 1 to 31. In US, on the other
hand, the principle of equality of representation of states in the Upper
House is fully recognised. Thus, the American Senate has 100 members,
two from each state. This principle is regarded as a safeguard for smaller
states.
6. Emergency Provisions
The Constitution stipulates three types of emergencies–national, state and
financial. During an emergency, the Central government becomes all
powerful and the states go into the total control of the Centre. It converts
the federal structure into a unitary one without a formal amendment of the
Constitution. This kind of transformation is not found in any other
federation.
7. Single Citizenship
In spite of a dual polity, the Constitution of India, like that of Canada,
adopted the system of single citizenship. There is only Indian Citizenship
and no separate state citizenship. All citizens irrespective of the state in
which they are born or reside enjoy the same rights all over the country. The
other federal states like US, Switzerland and Australia have dual
citizenship, that is, national citizenship as well as state citizenship.
8. Integrated Judiciary
The Indian Constitution has established an integrated judicial system with
the Supreme Court at the top and the state high courts below it. This single
system of courts enforces both the Central laws as well as the state laws. In
US, on the other hand, there is a double system of courts whereby the
federal laws are enforced by the federal judiciary and the state laws by the
state judiciary.
9. All-India Services
In US, the Federal government and the state governments have their
separate public services. In India also, the Centre and the states have their
separate public services. But, in addition, there are all-India services (IAS,
IPS, and IFS) which are common to both the Centre and the states. The
members of these services are recruited and trained by the Centre which
also possess ultimate control over them. Thus, these services violate the
principle of federalism under the Constitution.
10. Integrated Audit Machinery
The Comptroller and Auditor-General of India audits the accounts of not
only the Central government but also those of the states. But, his
appointment and removal is done by the president without consulting the
states. Hence, this office restricts the financial autonomy of the states. The
American Comptroller-General, on the contrary, has no role with respect to
the accounts of the states.
11. Parliament’s Authority Over State List
Even in the limited sphere of authority allotted to them, the states do not
have exclusive control. The Parliament is empowered to legislate on any
subject of the State List if Rajya Sabha passes a resolution to that effect in
the national interest. This means that the legislative competence of the
Parliament can be extended without amending the Constitution. Notably,
this can be done when there is no emergency of any kind.
12. Appointment of Governor
The governor, who is the head of the state, is appointed by the President. He
holds office during the pleasure of the President. He also acts as an agent of
the Centre. Through him, the Centre exercises control over the states. The
American Constitution, on the contrary, provided for an elected head in the
states. In this respect, India adopted the Canadian system.
13. Integrated Election Machinery
The Election Commission conducts elections not only to the Central
legislature but also to the state legislatures. But, this body is constituted by
the President and the states have no say in this matter. The position is same
with regard to the removal of its members as well. On the other hand, US
has separate machineries for the conduct of elections at the federal and state
levels.
14. Veto Over State Bills
The governor is empowered to reserve certain types of bills passed by the
state legislature for the consideration of the President. The President can
withhold his assent to such bills not only in the first instance but also in the
second instance. Thus, the President enjoys absolute veto (and not
suspensive veto) over state bills. But in US and Australia, the states are
autonomous within their fields and there is no provision for any such
reservation.
CRITICAL EVALUATION OF THE FEDERAL SYSTEM
From the above, it is clear that the Constitution of India has deviated from
the traditional federal systems like US, Switzerland and Australia and
incorporated a large number of unitary or non-federal features, tilting the
balance of power in favour of the Centre. This has prompted the
Constitutional experts to challenge the federal character of the Indian
Constitution. Thus, KC Wheare described the Constitution of India as
“quasi-federal”. He remarked that “Indian Union is a unitary state with
subsidiary federal features rather than a federal state with subsidiary unitary
features.”6
According to K Santhanam, the two factors have been responsible for
increasing the unitary bias (tendency of centralisation) of the Constitution.
These are: (i) the dominance of the Centre in the financial sphere and the
dependence of the states upon the Central grants; and (ii) the emergence of
a powerful erstwhile planning commission which controlled the
developmental process in the states6a
. He observed: “India has practically
functioned as a unitary state though the Union and the states have tried to
function formally and legally as a federation.”7
However, there are other political scientists who do not agree with the
above descriptions. Thus, Paul Appleby8 characterises the Indian system as
“extremely federal”. Morris Jones9
termed it as a “bargaining federalism”.
Ivor Jennings10 has described it as a “federation with a strong centralising
tendency”. He observed that “the Indian Constitution is mainly federal with
unique safeguards for enforcing national unity and growth”.
Alexandrowicz11 stated that “India is a case sui generis (i.e., unique in
character). Granville Austin12 called the Indian federalism as a “cooperative
federalism”. He said that though the Constitution of India has created a
strong Central government, it has not made the state governments weak and
has not reduced them to the level of administrative agencies for the
execution of policies of the Central government. He described the Indian
federation as “a new kind of federation to meet India’s peculiar needs”.
On the nature of Indian Constitution, Dr. B.R. Ambedkar made the
following observation in the Constituent Assembly: “The Constitution is a
Federal Constitution in as much as it establishes a dual polity. The Union is
not a league of states, united in a loose relationship, nor are the states the
agencies of the Union, deriving powers from it. Both the Union and the
states are created by the Constitution, both derive their respective authority
from the Constitution.”13 He further observed: “Yet the Constitution avoids
the tight mould of federalism and could be both unitary as well as federal
according to the requirements of time and circum-stances”.14 While replying
to the criticism of over-centralisation in the Constitution, he stated: “A
serious complaint is made on the ground that there is too much
centralisation and the states have been reduced to municipalities. It is clear
that this view is not only an exaggeration but is also founded on a
misunderstanding of what exactly the Constitution contrives to do. As to the
relations between the Centre and the states, it is necessary to bear in mind
the fundamental principle on which it rests. The basic principle of
federalism is that the legislative and executive authority is partitioned
between the Centre and the states not by any law to be made by the Centre
but by the Constitution itself. This is what the Constitution does. The states
are in no way dependent upon the Centre for their legislative or executive
authority. The states and the Centre are coequal in this matter. It is difficult
to see how such a Constitution can be called centralism. It is, therefore,
wrong to say that the states have been placed under the Centre. The Centre
cannot by its own will alter the boundary of this partition. Nor can the
judiciary”.15
In Bommai case16
(1994), the Supreme Court laid down that the
Constitution is federal and characterised federalism as its ‘basic feature’. It
observed: “The fact that under the scheme of our Constitution, greater
power is conferred upon the Centre vis-a-vis the states does not mean that
the states are mere appendages of the Centre. The states have an
independent constitutional existence. They are not satellites or agents of the
Centre. Within the sphere allotted to them, the states are supreme. The fact
that during emergency and in certain other eventualities their powers are
overridden or invaded by the Centre is not destructive of the essential
federal feature of the Constitution. They are exceptions and the exceptions
are not a rule. Let it be said that the federalism in the Indian Constitution is
not a matter of administrative convenience, but one of principle–the
outcome of our own process and a recognition of the ground realities”.
In fact, the federalism in India represents a compromise between the
following two conflicting considerations17
 :
(i) normal division of powers under which states enjoy
autonomy within their own spheres; and
(ii) need for national integrity and a strong Union government
under exceptional circumstances.
The following trends in the working of Indian political system reflects its
federal spirit: (i) Territorial disputes between states, for example, between
Maharashtra and Karnataka over Belgaum; (ii) Disputes between states over
sharing of river water, for example, between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu
over Cauvery Water; (iii) The emergence of regional parties and their
coming to power in states like Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, etc.; (iv) The
creation of new states to fulfil the regional aspirations, for example,
Mizoram or Jharkhand; (v) Demand of the states for more financial grants
from the Centre to meet their developmental needs; (vi) Assertion of
autonomy by the states and their resistance to the interference from the
Centre; (vii) Supreme Court’s imposition of several procedural limitations
on the use of Article 356 (President’s Rule in the States) by the Centre.18

14 Centre-State Relations
The Constitution of India, being federal in structure, divides all powers
(legislative, executive and financial) between the Centre and the states.
However, there is no division of judicial power as the Constitution has
established an integrated judicial system to enforce both the Central laws as
well as state laws.
Though the Centre and the states are supreme in their respective fields,
the maximum harmony and coordination between them is essential for the
effective operation of the federal system. Hence, the Constitution contains
elaborate provisions to regulate the various dimensions of the relations
between the Centre and the states.
The Centre-state relations can be studied under three heads:
•  Legislative relations.
•  Administrative relations.
•  Financial relations.
LEGISLATIVE RELATIONS
Articles 245 to 255 in Part XI of the Constitution deal with the legislative
relations between the Centre and the states. Besides these, there are some
other articles dealing with the same subject.
Like any other Federal Constitution, the Indian Constitution also divides
the legislative powers between the Centre and the states with respect to both
the territory and the subjects of legislation. Further, the Constitution
provides for the parliamentary legislation in the state field under five
extraordinary situations as well as the centre’s control over state legislation
in certain cases. Thus, there are four aspects in the Centre-states legislative
relations, viz.,
•  Territorial extent of Central and state legislation;
•  Distribution of legislative subjects;
•  Parliamentary legislation in the state field; and
•  Centre’s control over state legislation.
1. Territorial Extent of Central and State Legislation
The Constitution defines the territorial limits of the legislative powers
vested in the Centre and the states in the following way:
(i) The Parliament can make laws for the whole or any part of the
territory of India. The territory of India includes the states, the
union territories, and any other area for the time being included in
the territory of India.
(ii) A state legislature can make laws for the whole or any part of the
state. The laws made by a state legislature are not applicable
outside the state, except when there is a sufficient nexus between
the state and the object.
(iii) The Parliament alone can make ‘extraterritorial legislation’. Thus,
the laws of the Parliament are also applicable to the Indian
citizens and their property in any part of the world.
However, the Constitution places certain restrictions on the plenary
territorial jurisdiction of the Parliament. In other words, the laws of
Parliament are not applicable in the following areas:
(i) The President can make regulations for the peace, progress and
good government of the five Union Territories– the Andaman and
Nicobar Islands, Lakshadweep, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Daman
and Diu and Ladakh. A regulation so made has the same force
and effect as an act of Parliament. It may also repeal or amend
any act of Parliament in relation to these union territories.
(ii) The governor is empowered to direct that an act of Parliament
does not apply to a scheduled area in the state or apply with
specified modifications and exceptions.
(iii) The Governor of Assam may likewise direct that an act of
Parliament does not apply to a tribal area (autonomous district) in
the state or apply with specified modifications and exceptions.
The President enjoys the same power with respect to tribal areas
(autonomous districts) in Meghalaya, Tripura and Mizoram.
2. Distribution of Legislative Subjects
The Constitution provides for a three-fold distribution of legislative subjects
between the Centre and the states, viz., List-I (the Union List), List-II (the
State List) and List-III (the Concurrent List) in the Seventh Schedule:
(i) The Parliament has exclusive powers to make laws with respect
to any of the matters enumerated in the Union List. This list has at
present 98 subjects (originally 971 subjects) like defence, banking,
foreign affairs, currency, atomic energy, insurance,
communication, inter-state trade and commerce, census, audit and
so on.
(ii) The state legislature has “in normal circumstances” exclusive
powers to make laws with respect to any of the matters
enumerated in the State List. This has at present 59 subjects
(originally 662 subjects) like public order, police, public health
and sanitation, agriculture, prisons, local government, fisheries,
markets, theaters, gambling and so on.
(iii) Both, the Parliament and state legislature can make laws with
respect to any of the matters enumerated in the Concurrent List.
This list has at present 52 subjects (originally 473 subjects) like
criminal law and procedure, civil procedure, marriage and
divorce, population control and family planning, electricity,
labour welfare, economic and social planning, drugs, newspapers,
books and printing press, and others. The 42nd Amendment Act
of 1976 transferred five subjects to Concurrent List from State
List, that is, (a) education, (b) forests, (c) weights and measures,
(d) protection of wild animals and birds, and (e) administration of
justice; constitution and organisation of all courts except the
Supreme Court and the high courts.
(iv) Parliament has power to make laws with respect to any matter for
any part of the territory of India not included in a state even
though that matter is one which is enumerated in the State List.
This provision has reference to the Union Territories or the
Acquired Territories (if any).
(v) The 101st Amendment Act of 2016 has made a special provision
with respect to goods and services tax. Accordingly, the
Parliament and the state legislature have power to make laws with
respect to goods and services tax imposed by the Union or by the
State. Further, the parliament has exclusive power to make laws
with respect to goods and services tax where the supply of goods
or services or both takes place in the course of inter-state trade or
commerce.
(vi) The power to make laws with respect to residuary subjects (i.e.,
the matters which are not enumerated in any of the three lists) is
vested in the Parliament. This residuary power of legislation
includes the power to levy residuary taxes.
From the above scheme, it is clear that the matters of national importance
and the matters which require uniformity of legislation nationwide are
included in the Union List. The matters of regional and local importance
and the matters which permit diversity of interest are specified in the State
List. The matters on which uniformity of legislation throughout the country
is desirable but not essential are enumerated in the concurrent list. Thus, it
permits diversity along with uniformity.
In US, only the powers of the Federal Government are enumerated in the
Constitution and the residuary powers are left to the states. The Australian
Constitution followed the American pattern of single enumeration of
powers. In Canada, on the other hand, there is a double enumeration–
Federal and Provincial, and the residuary powers are vested in the Centre.
The Government of India Act of 1935 provided for a three-fold
enumeration, viz., federal, provincial and concurrent. The present
Constitution follows the scheme of this act but with one difference, that is,
under this act, the residuary powers were given neither to the federal
legislature nor to the provincial legislature but to the governor-general of
India. In this respect, India follows the Canadian precedent.
The Constitution expressly secures the predominance of the Union List
over the State List and the Concurrent List and that of the Concurrent List
over the State List. Thus, in case of overlapping between the Union List and
the State List, the former should prevail. In case of overlapping between the
Union List and the Concurrent List, it is again the former which should
prevail. Where there is a conflict between the Concurrent List and the State
List, it is the former that should prevail.
In case of a conflict between the Central law and the state law on a
subject enumerated in the Concurrent List, the Central law prevails over the
state law. But, there is an exception. If the state law has been reserved for
the consideration of the president and has received his assent, then the state
law prevails in that state. But, it would still be competent for the Parliament
to override such a law by subsequently making a law on the same matter.
3. Parliamentary Legislation in the State Field
The above scheme of distribution of legislative powers between the Centre
and the states is to be maintained in normal times. But, in abnormal times,
the scheme of distribution is either modified or suspended. In other words,
the Constitution empowers the Parliament to make laws on any matter
enumerated in the State List under the following five extraordinary
circumstances:
When Rajya Sabha Passes a Resolution
If the Rajya Sabha declares that it is necessary in the national interest that
Parliament should make laws with respect to goods and services tax3a or a
matter in the State List, then the Parliament becomes competent to make
laws on that matter. Such a resolution must be supported by two-thirds of
the members present and voting. The resolution remains in force for one
year; it can be renewed any number of times but not exceeding one year at a
time. The laws cease to have effect on the expiration of six months after the
resolution has ceased to be in force.
This provision does not restrict the power of a state legislature to make
laws on the same matter. But, in case of inconsistency between a state law
and a parliamentary law, the latter is to prevail.
During a National Emergency
The Parliament acquires the power to legislate with respect to goods and
services tax3b or matters in the State List, while a proclamation of national
emergency is in operation. The laws become inoperative on the expiration
of six months after the emergency has ceased to operate.
Here also, the power of a state legislature to make laws on the same
matter is not restricted. But, in case of repugnancy between a state law and
a parliamentary law, the latter is to prevail.
When States Make a Request
When the legislatures of two or more states pass resolutions requesting the
Parliament to enact laws on a matter in the State List, then the Parliament
can make laws for regulating that matter. A law so enacted applies only to
those states which have passed the resolutions. However, any other state
may adopt it afterwards by passing a resolution to that effect in its
legislature. Such a law can be amended or repealed only by the Parliament
and not by the legislatures of the concerned states.
The effect of passing a resolution under the above provision is that the
Parliament becomes entitled to legislate with respect to a matter for which it
has no power to make a law. On the other hand, the state legislature ceases
to have the power to make a law with respect to that matter. The resolution
operates as abdication or surrender of the power of the state legislature with
respect to that matter and it is placed entirely in the hands of Parliament
which alone can then legislate with respect to it.
Some examples of laws passed under the above provision are Prize
Competition Act, 1955; Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972; Water
(Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974; Urban Land (Ceiling and
Regulation) Act, 1976; and Transplantation of Human Organs Act, 1994.
To Implement International Agreements
The Parliament can make laws on any matter in the State List for
implementing the international treaties, agreements or conventions. This
provision enables the Central government to fulfil its international
obligations and commitments.
Some examples of laws enacted under the above provision are United
Nations (Privileges and Immunities) Act, 1947; Geneva Convention Act,
1960; Anti-Hijacking Act, 1982 and legislations relating to environment
and TRIPS.
During President’s Rule
When the President’s rule is imposed in a state, the Parliament becomes
empowered to make laws with respect to any matter in the State List in
relation to that state. A law made so by the Parliament continues to be
operative even after the president’s rule. This means that the period for
which such a law remains in force is not coterminous with the duration of
the President’s rule. But, such a law can be repealed or altered or re-enacted
by the state legislature.
4. Centre’s Control Over State Legislation
Besides the Parliament’s power to legislate directly on the state subjects
under the exceptional situations, the Constitution empowers the Centre to
exercise control over the state’s legislative matters in the following ways:
(i) The governor can reserve certain types of bills passed by the state
legislature for the consideration of the President. The president
enjoys absolute veto over them.
(ii) Bills on certain matters enumerated in the State List can be
introduced in the state legislature only with the previous sanction
of the president. (For example, the bills imposing restrictions on
the freedom of trade and commerce).
(iii) The Centre can direct the states to reserve money bills and other
financial bills passed by the state legislature for the President’s
consideration during a financial emergency.
From the above, it is clear that the Constitution has assigned a position of
superiority to the Centre in the legislative sphere. In this context, the
Sarkaria Commission on Centre-State Relations (1983–88) observed: “The
rule of federal supremacy is a technique to avoid absurdity, resolve conflict
and ensure harmony between the Union and state laws. If this principle of
union supremacy is excluded, it is not difficult to imagine its deleterious
results. There will be every possibility of our two-tier political system being
stultified by interference, strife, legal chaos and confusion caused by a host
of conflicting laws, much to the bewilderment of the common citizen.
Integrated legislative policy and uniformity on basic issues of common
Union-state concern will be stymied. The federal principle of unity in
diversity will be very much a casualty. This rule of federal supremacy,
therefore, is indispensable for the successful functioning of the federal
system”.4
ADMINISTRATIVE RELATIONS
Articles 256 to 263 in Part XI of the Constitution deal with the
administrative relations between the Centre and the states. In addition, there
are various other articles pertaining to the same matter.
Distribution of Executive Powers
The executive power has been divided between the Centre and the states on
the lines of the distribution of legislative powers, except in few cases. Thus,
the executive power of the Centre extends to the whole of India: (i) to the
matters on which the Parliament has exclusive power of legislation (i.e., the
subjects enumerated in the Union List); and (ii) to the exercise of rights,
authority and jurisdiction conferred on it by any treaty or agreement.
Similarly, the executive power of a state extends to its territory in respect of
matters on which the state legislature has exclusive power of legislation
(i.e., the subjects enumerated in the State List).
In respect of matters on which both the Parliament and the state
legislatures have power of legislation (i.e., the subjects enumerated in the
Concurrent List), the executive power rests with the states except when a
Constitutional provision or a parliamentary law specifically confers it on
the Centre. Therefore, a law on a concurrent subject, though enacted by the
Parliament, is to be executed by the states except when the Constitution or
the Parliament has directed otherwise.5
Obligation of States and the Centre
The Constitution has placed two restrictions on the executive power of the
states in order to give ample scope to the Centre for exercising its executive
power in an unrestricted manner. Thus, the executive power of every state is
to be exercised in such a way (a) as to ensure compliance with the laws
made by the Parliament and any existing law which apply in the state; and
(b) as not to impede or prejudice the exercise of executive power of the
Centre in the state. While the former lays down a general obligation upon
the state, the latter imposes a specific obligation on the state not to hamper
the executive power of the Centre.

254. 
Inconsistency between laws made by Parliament and laws made
by the legislatures of states 
255.  Requirements as to recommendations and previous sanctions to be
regarded as matters of procedure only 
In both the cases, the executive power of the Centre extends to giving of
such directions to the state as are necessary for the purpose. The sanction
behind these directions of the Centre is coercive in nature. Thus, Article
365 says that where any state has failed to comply with (or to give effect to)
any directions given by the Centre, it will be lawful for the President to hold
that a situation has arisen in which the government of the state cannot be
carried on in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution. It means
that, in such a situation, the President’s rule can be imposed in the state
under Article 356.
Centre’s Directions to the States
In addition to the above two cases, the Centre is empowered to give
directions to the states with regard to the exercise of their executive power
in the following matters:
(i) the construction and maintenance of means of communication
(declared to be of national or military importance) by the state;
(ii) the measures to be taken for the protection of the railways within
the state;
(iii) the provision of adequate facilities for instruction in the mothertongue at the primary stage of education to children belonging to
linguistic minority groups in the state; and
(iv) the drawing up and execution of the specified schemes for the
welfare of the Scheduled Tribes in the state.
The coercive sanction behind the Central directions under Article 365
(mentioned above) is also applicable in these cases.
Mutual Delegation of Functions
The distribution of legislative powers between the Centre and the states is
rigid. Consequently, the Centre cannot delegate its legislative powers to the
states and a single state cannot request the Parliament to make a law on a
state subject. The distribution of executive power in general follows the
distribution of legislative powers. But, such a rigid division in the executive
sphere may lead to occasional conflicts between the two. Hence, the
Constitution provides for inter-government delegation of executive
functions in order to mitigate rigidity and avoid a situation of deadlock.
Accordingly, the President may, with the consent of the state government,
entrust to that government any of the executive functions of the Centre.
Conversely, the governor of a state may, with the consent of the Central
government, entrust to that government any of the executive functions of
the state.6 This mutual delegation of administrative functions may be
conditional or unconditional.
The Constitution also makes a provision for the entrustment of the
executive functions of the Centre to a state without the consent of that state.
But, in this case, the delegation is by the Parliament and not by the
president. Thus, a law made by the Parliament on a subject of the Union
List can confer powers and impose duties on a state, or authorise the
conferring of powers and imposition of duties by the Centre upon a state
(irrespective of the consent of the state concerned). Notably, the same thing
cannot be done by the state legislature.
From the above, it is clear that the mutual delegation of functions
between the Centre and the state can take place either under an agreement
or by a legislation. While the Centre can use both the methods, a state can
use only the first method.
Cooperation Between the Centre and States
The Constitution contains the following provisions to secure cooperation
and coordination between the Centre and the states:
(i) The Parliament can provide for the adjudication of any dispute or
complaint with respect to the use, distribution and control of
waters of any inter-state river and river valley.
(ii) The President can establish (under Article 263) an Inter-State
Council to investigate and discuss subject of common interest
between the Centre and the states. Such a council was set up in
1990.7
(iii) Full faith and credit is to be given throughout the territory of
India to public acts, records and judicial proceedings of the
Centre and every state.
(iv) The Parliament can appoint an appropriate authority to carry out
the purposes of the constitutional provisions relating to the
interstate freedom of trade, commerce and intercourse. But, no
such authority has been appointed so far.
All-India Services
Like in any other federation, the Centre and the states also have their
separate public services called as the Central Services and the State
Services respectively. In addition, there are all-India services–IAS, IPS and
IFS. The members of these services occupy top positions (or key posts)
under both the Centre and the states and serve them by turns. But, they are
recruited and trained by the Centre.
These services are controlled jointly by the Centre and the states. The
ultimate control lies with the Central government while the immediate
control vests with the state governments.
In 1947, Indian Civil Service (ICS) was replaced by IAS and the Indian
Police (IP) was replaced by IPS and were recognised by the Constitution as
All-India Services. In 1966, the Indian Forest Service (IFS) was created as
the third All-India Service. Article 312 of the Constitution authorises the
Parliament to create new All-India Services on the basis of a Rajya Sabha
resolution to that effect.
Each of these three all-India services, irrespective of their division among
different states, form a single service with common rights and status and
uniform scales of pay throughout the country.
Though the all-India services violate the principle of federalism under the
Constitution by restricting the autonomy and patronage of the states, they
are supported on the ground that (i) they help in maintaining high standard
of administration in the Centre as well as in the states; (ii) they help to
ensure uniformity of the administrative system throughout the country; and
(iii) they facilitate liaison, cooperation, coordination and joint action on the
issues of common interest between the Centre and the states.
While justifying the institution of all-India services in the Constituent
Assembly, Dr. B.R. Ambedkar observed that: “The dual polity which is
inherent in a federal system is followed in all federations by a dual service.
In all federations, there is a Federal Civil Service and a State Civil Service.
The Indian federation, though a dual polity, will have a dual service, but
with one exception. It is recognised that in every country there are certain
posts in its administrative set up which might be called strategic from the
point of view of maintaining the standard of administration. There can be
no doubt that the standard of administration depends upon the calibre of the
civil servants who are appointed to the strategic posts. The Constitution
provides that without depriving the states of their rights to form their own
civil services, there shall be an all-India service, recruited on an allIndia
basis with common qualifications, with uniform scale of pay and members
of which alone could be appointed to those strategic posts throughout the
Union”.8
Public Service Commissions
In the field of public service commissions, the Centre-state relations are as
follows:
(i) The Chairman and members of a state public service commission,
though appointed by the governor of the state, can be removed
only by the President.
(ii) The Parliament can establish a Joint State Public Service
Commission (JSPSC) for two or more states on the request of the
state legislatures concerned. The chairman and members of the
JSPSC are appointed by the president.
(iii) The Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) can serve the
needs of a state on the request of the state governor and with the
approval of the President.
(iv) The UPSC assists the states (when requested by two or more
states) in framing and operating schemes of joint recruitment for
any services for which candidates possessing special
qualifications are required.
Integrated Judicial System
Though India has a dual polity, there is no dual system of administration of
justice. The Constitution, on the other hand, established an integrated
judicial system with the Supreme Court at the top and the state high courts
below it. This single system of courts enforces both the Central laws as well
as the state laws. This is done to eliminate diversities in the remedial
procedure.
The judges of a state high court are appointed by the president in
consultation with the Chief Justice of India and the governor of the state.
They can also be transferred and removed by the president.
The Parliament can establish a common high court for two or more
states. For example, Maharashtra and Goa or Punjab and Haryana have a
common high court.
Relations During Emergencies
(i) During the operation of a national emergency (under Article 352),
the Centre becomes entitled to give executive directions to a state
on ‘any’ matter. Thus, the state governments are brought under
the complete control of the Centre, though they are not
suspended.
(ii) When the President’s Rule is imposed in a state (under Article
356), the President can assume to himself the functions of the
state government and powers vested in the Governor or any other
executive authority in the state.
(iii) During the operation of a financial emergency (under Article
360), the Centre can direct the states to observe canons of
financial propriety and can give other necessary directions
including the reduction of salaries of persons serving in the state.
Other Provisions
The Constitution contains the following other provisions which enable the
Centre to exercise control over the state administration:
(i) Article 355 imposes two duties on the Centre: (a) to protect every
state against external aggression and internal disturbance; and (b)
to ensure that the government of every state is carried on in
accordance with the provisions of the Constitution.
(ii) The governor of a state is appointed by the president. He holds
office during the pleasure of the President. In addition to the
Constitutional head of the state, the governor acts as an agent of
the Centre in the state. He submits periodical reports to the Centre
about the administrative affairs of the state.
(iii) The state election commissioner, though appointed by the
governor of the state, can be removed only by the President.
Extra-Constitutional Devices
In addition to the above-mentioned constitutional devices, there are extraconstitutional devices to promote cooperation and coordination between the
Centre and the states. These include a number of advisory bodies and
conferences held at the Central level.
The non-constitutional advisory bodies include the NITI Ayog (which
succeeded the planning commission),9
the National Integration Council,10
the Central Council of Health and Family Welfare, the Central Council of
Local Government, the Zonal Councils,11
the North-Eastern Council, the
Central Council of Indian Medicine, the Central Council of Homoeopathy,
the Transport Development Council, the University Grants Commission and
so on.
The important conferences held either annually or otherwise to facilitate
Centrestate consultation on a wide range of matters are as follows: (i) The
governors’ conference (presided over by the President). (ii) The chief
ministers’ conference (presided over by the prime minister). (iii) The chief
secretaries’ conference (presided over by the cabinet secretary). (iv) The
conference of inspector-general of police. (v) The chief justices’ conference
(presided over by the chief justice of India). (vi) The conference of vicechancellors. (vii) The home ministers’ conference (presided over by the
Central home minister). (viii) The law ministers’ conference (presided over
by the Central law minister).
FINANCIAL RELATIONS
Articles 268 to 293 in Part XII of the Constitution deal with Centre-state
financial relations. Besides these, there are other provisions dealing with the
same subject. These together can be studied under the following heads:
Allocation of Taxing Powers
The Constitution divides the taxing powers between the Centre and the
states in the following way:
•  The Parliament has exclusive power to levy taxes on subjects
enumerated in the Union List (which are 13 in number12
 ).
•  The state legislature has exclusive power to levy taxes on subjects
enumerated in the State List (which are 18 in number13
 ).
•  There are no tax entries in the Concurrent List. In other words, the
concurrent jurisdiction is not available with respect to tax legislation.
But, the 101st Amendment Act of 2016 has made an exception by
making a special provision with respect to goods and services tax. This
Amendment has conferred concurrent power upon Parliament and
State Legislatures to make laws governing goods and services tax14
 .
•  The residuary power of taxation (that is, the power to impose taxes
not enumerated in any of the three lists) is vested in the Parliament.
Under this provision, the Parliament has imposed gift tax, wealth tax
and expenditure tax.
Table 14.2  Articles Related to Centre-State Administrative Relations at a
Glance
Article
No.
Subject Matter
256.  Obligation of states and the Union 
257.  Control of the Union over states in certain cases 
257A.  Assistance to states by deployment of armed forces or other
forces of the Union (Repealed) 
258.  Power of the Union to confer powers, etc., on states in certain

263.  Provisions with respect to an inter-state Council 
The Constitution also draws a distinction between the power to levy and
collect a tax and the power to appropriate the proceeds of the tax so levied
and collected. For example, the income-tax is levied and collected by the
Centre but its proceeds are distributed between the Centre and the states.
Further, the Constitution has placed the following restrictions on the
taxing powers of the states:
(i) A state legislature can impose taxes on professions, trades,
callings and employments. But, the total amount of such taxes
payable by any person should not exceed ₹2,500 per annum.15
(ii) A state legislature is prohibited from imposing a tax on the supply
of goods or services or both in the following two cases : (a) where
such supply takes place outside the state; and (b) where such
supply takes place in the course of import or export. Further, the
Parliament is empowered to formulate the principles for
determining when a supply of goods or services or both takes
place outside the state, or in the course of import or export16
 .
(iii) A state legislature can impose tax on the consumption or sale of
electricity. But, no tax can be imposed on the consumption or sale
of electricity which is (a) consumed by the Centre or sold to the
Centre; or (b) consumed in the construction, maintenance or
operation of any railway by the Centre or by the concerned
railway company or sold to the Centre or the railway company for
the same purpose.
(iv) A state legislature can impose a tax in respect of any water or
electricity stored, generated, consumed, distributed or sold by any
authority established by Parliament for regulating or developing
any inter-state river or river valley. But, such a law, to be
effective, should be reserved for the president’s consideration and
receive his assent.
Distribution of Tax Revenues
The 80th Amendment Act of 2000 and the 101st Amendment Act of 2016
have introduced major changes in the scheme of the distribution of tax
revenues between the centre and the states.
The 80th Amendment was enacted to give effect to the recommendations
of the 10thFinance Commission. The Commission recommended that out of
the total income obtained from certain central taxes and duties, 29% should
go to the states. This is known as the ‘Alternative Scheme of Devolution’
and came into effect retrospectively from April 1, 1996. This amendment
has brought several central taxes and duties like Corporation Tax and
Customs Duties at par with Income Tax (taxes on income other than
agricultural income) as far as their constitutionally mandated sharing with
the states is concerned.17
The 101st Amendment has paved the way for the introduction of a new
tax regime (i.e., goods and services tax - GST) in the country. Accordingly,
the Amendment conferred concurrent taxing powers upon the Parliament
and the State Legislatures to make laws for levying GST on every
transaction of supply of goods or services or both. The GST replaced a
number of indirect taxes levied by the Union and the State Governments
and is intended to remove cascading effect of taxes and provide for a
common national market for goods and services. The Amendment provided
for subsuming of various central indirect taxes and levies such as (i) Central
Excise Duty, (ii) Additional Excise Duties, (iii) Excise Duty levied under
the Medicinal and Toilet Preparations (Excise Duties) Act, 1955, (iv)
Service Tax, (v) Additional Customs Duty commonly known as
Countervailing Duty, (vi) Special Additional Duty of Customs, and (vii)
Central Surcharges and Cesses so far as they related to the supply of goods
and services. Similarly, the Amendment provided for subsuming of (i) State
Value Added Tax / Sales Tax, (ii) Entertainment Tax (other than the tax
levied by the local bodies), (iii) Central Sales Tax (levied by the Centre and
collected by the States), (iv) Octroi and Entry Tax, (v) Purchase Tax, (vi)
Luxury Tax, (vii) Taxes on lottery, betting and gambling, and (viii) State
Surcharges and Cesses in so far as they related to the supply of goods and
services. Further, the Amendment deleted Article 268-A as well as Entry
92-C in the Union List, both were dealing with service tax. They were
added earlier by the 88th Amendment Act of 2003. The service tax was
levied by the Centre but collected and appropriated by both the Centre and
the States.
After the above two amendments (i.e., 80th Amendment and 101st
Amendment), the present position with respect to the distribution of tax
revenues between the centre and the states is as follows:
A. Taxes Levied by the Centre but Collected and Appropriated by the
States (Article 268): This category includes the stamp duties on bills of
exchange, cheques, promissory notes, policies of insurance, transfer of
shares and others.
The proceeds of these duties levied within any state do not form a part of
the Consolidated Fund of India, but are assigned to that state.
B. Taxes Levied and Collected by the Centre but Assigned to the States
(Article 269):   The following taxes fall under this category:
(i) Taxes on the sale or purchase of goods (other than newspapers) in
the course of inter-state trade or commerce.
(ii) Taxes on the consignment of goods in the course of inter-state
trade or commerce.
The net proceeds of these taxes do not form a part of the Consolidated
Fund of India. They are assigned to the concerned states in accordance with
the principles laid down by the Parliament.
C. Levy and Collection of Goods and Services Tax in Course of InterState Trade or Commerce (Article 269-A): The Goods and Services Tax
(GST) on supplies in the course of inter-state trade or commerce are levied
and collected by the Centre. But, this tax is divided between the Centre and
the States in the manner provided by Parliament on the recommendations of
the GST Council. Further, the Parliament is also authorized to formulate the
principles for determining the place of supply, and when a supply of goods
or services or both takes place in the course of inter-state trade or
commerce.
D. Taxes Levied and Collected by the Centre but Distributed between
the Centre and the States (Article 270): This category includes all taxes
and duties referred to in the Union List except the following:
(i) Duties and taxes referred to in Articles 268, 269 and 269-A
(mentioned above);
(ii) Surcharge on taxes and duties referred to in Article 271
(mentioned below); and
(iii) Any cess levied for specific purposes.
The manner of distribution of the net proceeds of these taxes and duties is
prescribed by the President on the recommendation of the Finance
Commission.
E. Surcharge on Certain Taxes and Duties for Purposes of the Centre
(Article 271): The Parliament can at any time levy the surcharges on taxes
and duties referred to in Articles 269 and 270 (mentioned above). The
proceeds of such surcharges go to the Centre exclusively. In other words,
the states have no share in these surcharges.
However, the Goods and Services Tax (GST) is exempted from this
surcharge. In other words, this surcharge can not be imposed on the GST.
F. Taxes Levied and Collected and Retained by the States: These are
the taxes belonging to the states exclusively. They are enumerated in the
state list and are 18 in number. These are18
: (i) land revenue; (ii) taxes on
agricultural income; (iii) duties in respect of succession to agricultural land;
(iv) estate duty in respect of agricultural land; (v) taxes on lands and
buildings; (vi) taxes on mineral rights; (vii) Duties of excise on alcoholic
liquors for human consumption; opium, Indian hemp and other narcotic
drugs and narcotics, but not including medicinal and toilet preparations
containing alcohol or narcotics; (viii) taxes on the consumption or sale or
electricity; (ix) taxes on the sale of petroleum crude, high speed diesel,
motor spirit (commonly known as petrol), natural gas, aviation turbine fuel
and alcoholic liquor for human consumption, but not including sale in the
course of inter-state trade or commerce or sale in the course of international
trade or commerce of such goods; (x) taxes on goods and passengers carried
by road or inland waterways; (xi) taxes on vehicles; (xii) taxes on animals
and boats; (xiii) tolls; (xiv) taxes on professions, trades, callings and
employments; (xv) capitation taxes; (xvi) taxes on entertainments and
amusements to the extent levied and collected by a Panchayat or a
Municipality or a Regional Council or a District Council; (xvii) stamp duty
on documents (except those specified in the Union List); and (xviii) fees on
the matters enumerated in the State List (except court fees).
Distribution of Non-tax Revenues
A. The Centre
The receipts from the following form the major sources of non-tax revenues
of the Centre: (i) posts and telegraphs; (ii) railways; (iii) banking; (iv)
broadcasting (v) coinage and currency; (vi) central public sector enterprises;
(vii) escheat and lapse;19
 and (viii) others.
B. The States
The receipts from the following form the major sources of non-tax revenues
of the states: (i) irrigation; (ii) forests; (iii) fisheries; (iv) state public sector
enterprises; (v) escheat and lapse;20
 and (vi) others.
Grants-in-Aid to the States
Besides sharing of taxes between the Centre and the states, the Constitution
provides for grants-in-aid to the states from the Central resources. There are
two types of grants-in-aid, viz, statutory grants and discretionary grants:
Statutory Grants
Article 275 empowers the Parliament to make grants to the states which are
in need of financial assistance and not to every state. Also, different sums
may be fixed for different states. These sums are charged on the
Consolidated Fund of India every year.
Apart from this general provision, the Constitution also provides for
specific grants for promoting the welfare of the scheduled tribes in a state or
for raising the level of administration of the scheduled areas in a state
including the State of Assam.
The statutory grants under Article 275 (both general and specific) are
given to the states on the recommendation of the Finance Commission.
Discretionary Grants
Article 282 empowers both the Centre and the states to make any grants for
any public purpose, even if it is not within their respective legislative
competence. Under this provision, the Centre makes grants to the states.
“These grants are also known as discretionary grants, the reason being
that the Centre is under no obligation to give these grants and the matter lies
within its discretion. These grants have a two-fold purpose: to help the state
financially to fulfil plan targets; and to give some leverage to the Centre to
influence and coordinate state action to effectuate the national plan.”21
Other Grants
The Constitution also provided for a third type of grants-in-aid, but for a
temporary period. Thus, a provision was made for grants in lieu of export
duties on jute and jute products to the States of Assam, Bihar, Orissa and
West Bengal. These grants were to be given for a period of ten years from
the commencement of the Constitution. These sums were charged on the
Consolidated Fund of India and were made to the states on the
recommendation of the Finance Commission.
Goods and Services Tax Council
The smooth and efficient administration of the goods and services tax
(GST) requires a co-operation and co-ordination between the Centre and the
States. In order to facilitate this consultation process, the 101st Amendment
Act of 2016 provided for the establishment of a Goods and Services Tax
Council or the GST Council.
Article 279-A empowered the President to constitute a GST Council by
an order22
. The Council is a joint forum of the Centre and the States. It is
required to make recommendations to the Centre and the States on the
following matters:
(a)  The taxes, cesses and surcharges levied by the Centre, the States
and the local bodies that would get merged in GST.
(b)  The goods and services that may be subjected to GST or exempted
from GST.
(c)  Model GST Laws, principles of levy, apportionment of GST levied
on supplies in the course of inter-state trade or commerce and the
principles that govern the place of supply.
(d)  The threshold limit of turnover below which goods and services
may be exempted from GST.
(e)  The rates including floor rates with bands of GST.
(f)  Any special rate or rates for a specified period to raise additional
resources during any natural calamity or disaster.
Finance Commission
Article 280 provides for a Finance Commission as a quasi-judicial body. It
is constituted by the President every fifth year or even earlier. It is required
to make recommendations to the President on the following matters:
•  The distribution of the net proceeds of taxes to be shared between
the Centre and the states, and the allocation between the states, the
respective shares of such proceeds.
•  The principles which should govern the grants-in-aid to the states by
the Centre (i.e., out of the Consolidated Fund of India).
•  The measures needed to augment the Consolidated fund of a state to
supplement the resources of the panchayats and the municipalities in
the state on the basis of the recommendations made by the State
Finance Commission.23
•  Any other matter referred to it by the President in the interests of
sound finance.
Till 1960, the Commission also suggested the amounts paid to the States
of Assam, Bihar, Orissa and West Bengal in lieu of assignment of any share
of the net proceeds in each year of export duty on jute and jute products.
The Constitution envisages the Finance Commission as the balancing
wheel of fiscal federalism in India.
Protection of the States’ Interest
To protect the interest of states in the financial matters, the Constitution lays
down that the following bills can be introduced in the Parliament only on
the recommendation of the President:
•  A bill which imposes or varies any tax or duty in which states are
interested;
•  A bill which varies the meaning of the expression ‘agricultural
income’ as defined for the purposes of the enactments relating to
Indian income tax;
•  A bill which affects the principles on which moneys are or may be
distributable to states; and
•  A bill which imposes any surcharge on any specified tax or duty for
the purpose of the Centre.
The expression “tax or duty in which states are interested” means: (a) a
tax or duty the whole or part of the net proceeds whereof are assigned to
any state; or (b) a tax or duty by reference to the net proceeds whereof sums
are for the time being payable, out of the Consolidated Fund of India to any
state.
The phrase ‘net proceeds’ means the proceeds of a tax or a duty minus
the cost of collection. The net proceeds of a tax or a duty in any area is to be
ascertained and certified by the Comptroller and Auditor-General of India.
His certificate is final.
Borrowing by the Centre and the States
The Constitution makes the following provisions with regard to the
borrowing powers of the Centre and the states:
•  The Central government can borrow either within India or outside
upon the security of the Consolidated Fund of India or can give
guarantees, but both within the limits fixed by the Parliament. So far,
no such law has been enacted by the Parliament.
•  Similarly, a state government can borrow within India (and not
abroad) upon the security of the Consolidated Fund of the State or can
give guarantees, but both within the limits fixed by the legislature of
that state.
•  The Central government can make loans to any state or give
guarantees in respect of loans raised by any state. Any sums required
for the purpose of making such loans are to be charged on the
Consolidated Fund of India.
•  A state cannot raise any loan without the consent of the Centre, if
there is still outstanding any part of a loan made to the state by the
Centre or in respect of which a guarantee has been given by the
Centre.
Inter-Governmental Tax Immunities
Like any other federal Constitution, the Indian Constitution also contain the
rule of ‘immunity from mutual taxation’ and makes the following
provisions in this regard:
Exemption of Central Property from State Taxation
The property of Centre is exempted from all taxes imposed by a state or any
authority within a state like municipalities, district boards, panchayats and
so on. But, the Parliament is empowered to remove this ban. The word
‘property’ includes lands, buildings, chattels, shares, debts, everything that
has a money value, and every kind of property–movable or immovable and
tangible or intangible. Further, the property may be used for sovereign (like
armed forces) or commercial purposes.
The corporations or the companies created by the Central government are
not immune from state taxation or local taxation. The reason is that a
corporation or a company is a separate legal entity.
Exemption of State Property or Income from Central Taxation
The property and income of a state is exempted from Central taxation. Such
income may be derived from sovereign functions or commercial functions.
But the Centre can tax the commercial operations of a state if Parliament so
provides. However, the Parliament can declare any particular trade or
business as incidental to the ordinary functions of the government and it
would then not be taxable.
Notably, the property and income of local authorities situated within a
state are not exempted from the Central taxation. Similarly, the property or
income of corporations and companies owned by a state can be taxed by the
Centre.
The Supreme Court, in an advisory opinion24
(1963), held that the
immunity granted to a state in respect of Central taxation does not extend to
the duties of customs or duties of excise. In other words, the Centre can
impose customs duty on goods imported or exported by a state, or an excise
duty on goods produced or manufactured by a state.
Effects of Emergencies
The Centre-state financial relations in normal times (described above)
undergo changes during emergencies. These are as follows:
National Emergency
While the proclamation of national emergency (under Article 352) is in
operation, the president can modify the constitutional distribution of
revenues between the Centre and the states. This means that the president
can either reduce or cancel the transfer of finances (both tax sharing and
grants-in-aid) from the Centre to the states. Such modification continues till
the end of the financial year in which the emergency ceases to operate.
Financial Emergency
While the proclamation of financial emergency (under Article 360) is in
operation, the Centre can give directions to the states: (i) to observe the
specified canons of financial propriety; (ii) to reduce the salaries and
allowances of all class of persons serving in the state; and (iii) to reserve all
money bills and other financial bills for the consideration of the President.

TRENDS IN CENTRE-STATE RELATIONS
Till 1967, the centre-state relations by and large were smooth due to oneparty rule at the Centre and in most of the states. In 1967 elections, the
Congress party was defeated in nine states and its position at the Centre
became weak. This changed political scenario heralded a new era in the
Centre-state relations. The non-Congress Governments in the states
opposed the increasing centralisation and intervention of the Central
government. They raised the issue of state autonomy and demanded more
powers and financial resources to the states. This caused tensions and
conflicts in Centre-state relations.
Tension Areas in Centre-State Relations
The issues which created tensions and conflicts between the Centre and
states are: (1) Mode of appointment and dismissal of governor; (2)
Discriminatory and partisan role of governors; (3) Imposition of President’s
Rule for partisan interests; (4) Deployment of Central forces in the states to
maintain law and order; (5) Reservation of state bills for the consideration
of the President; (6) Discrimination in financial allocations to the states; (7)
Role of Planning Commission in approving state projects; (8) Management
of All-India Services (IAS, IPS, and IFS); (9) Use of electronic media for
political purposes; (10) Appointment of enquiry commissions against the
chief ministers; (11) Sharing of finances (between Centre and states); and
(12) Encroachment by the Centre on the State List.
The issues in Centre-State relations have been under consideration since
the mid 1960s. In this direction, the following developments have taken
place:
Administrative Reforms Commission
The Central government appointed a six-member Administrative Reforms
Commission (ARC) in 1966 under the chairmanship of Morarji Desai
(followed by K Hanumanthayya). Its terms of references included, among
others, the examination of Centre-State relations. In order to examine
thoroughly the various issues in Centre-state relations, the ARC constituted
a study team under M.C. Setalvad. On the basis of the report of this study
team, the ARC finalised its own report and submitted it to the Central
government in 1969. It made 22 recommendations for improving the
Centre-state relations. The important recommendations are:
•  Establishment of an Inter-State Council under Article 263 of the
Constitution.
•  Appointment of persons having long experience in public life and
administration and non-partisan attitude as governors.
•  Delegation of powers to the maximum extent to the states.
•  Transferring of more financial resources to the states to reduce their
dependency upon the Centre.
•  Deployment of Central armed forces in the states either on their
request or otherwise.
No action was taken by the Central government on the recommendations
of the ARC.
Rajamannar Committee
In 1969, the Tamil Nadu Government (DMK) appointed a three-member
committee under the chairmanship of Dr. P.V. Rajamannar to examine the
entire question of Centre-state relations and to suggest amendments to the
Constitution so as to secure utmost autonomy to the states.25 The committee
submitted its report to the Tamil Nadu Government in 1971.
The Committee identified the reasons for the prevailing unitary trends
(tendencies of centralisation) in the country. They include: (i) certain
provisions in the Constitution which confer special powers on the Centre;
(ii) one-party rule both at the Centre and in the states; (iii) inadequacy of
states’ fiscal resources and consequent dependence on the Centre for
financial assistance; and (iv) the institution of Central planning and the role
of the Planning Commission.
The important recommendations of the committee are as follows: (i) An
Inter-State Council should be set up immediately; (ii) Finance Commission
should be made a permanent body; (iii) Planning Commission should be
disbanded and its place should be taken by a statutory body; (iv) Articles
356, 357 and 365 (dealing with President’s Rule) should be totally omitted;
(v) The provision that the state ministry holds office during the pleasure of
the governor should be omitted; (vi) Certain subjects of the Union List and
the Concurrent List should be transferred to the State List; (vii) the
residuary powers should be allocated to the states; and (viii) All-India
services (IAS, IPS and IFS) should be abolished.
The Central government completely ignored the recommendations of the
Rajamannar Committee.
Anandpur Sahib Resolution
In 1973, the Akali Dal adopted a resolution containing both political and
religious demands in a meeting held at Anandpur Sahib in Punjab. The
resolution, generally known as Anandpur Sahib Resolution, demanded that
the Centre’s jurisdiction should be restricted only to defence, foreign affairs,
communications, and currency and the entire residuary powers should be
vested in the states. It stated that the Constitution should be made federal in
the real sense and should ensure equal authority and representation to all the
states at the Centre.
West Bengal Memorandum
In 1977, the West Bengal Government (led by the Communists) published a
memorandum on Centre-state relations and sent to the Central government.
The memorandum inter alia suggested the following: (i) The word ‘union’
in the Constitution should be replaced by the word ‘federal’; (ii) The
jurisdiction of the Centre should be confined to defence, foreign affairs,
currency, communications and economic co-ordination; (iii) All other
subjects including the residuary should be vested in the states; (iv) Articles
356 and 357 (President’s Rule) and 360 (financial emergency) should be
repealed; (v) State’s consent should be made obligatory for formation of
new states or reorganisation of existing states; (vi) Of the total revenue
raised by the Centre from all sources, 75 per cent should be allocated to the
states; (vii) Rajya Sabha should have equal powers with that of the Lok
Sabha; and (viii) There should be only Central and state services and the
allIndia services should be abolished.
The Central government did not accept the demands made in the
memorandum.
Sarkaria Commission
In 1983, the Central government appointed a three-member Commission on
Centrestate relations under the chairmanship of R.S. Sarkaria, a retired
judge of the Supreme Court.26 The commission was asked to examine and
review the working of existing arrangements between the Centre and states
in all spheres and recommend appropriate changes and measures. It was
initially given one year to complete its work, but its term was extended four
times. It submitted it’s report in 1988.
The Commission did not favour structural changes and regarded the
existing constitutional arrangements and principles relating to the
institutions basically sound. But, it emphasised on the need for changes in
the functional or operational aspects. It observed that federalism is more a
functional arrangement for co-operative action than a static institutional
concept. It outrightly rejected the demand for curtailing the powers of the
Centre and stated that a strong Centre is essential to safeguard the national
unity and integrity which is being threatened by the fissiparious tendencies
in the body politic. However, it did not equate strong Centre with
centralisation of powers. It observed that over-centralisation leads to blood
pressure at the centre and anaemia at the periphery.
The Commission made 247 recommendations to improve Centre-state
relations. The important recommendations are mentioned below:
1.  A permanent Inter-State Council called the Inter-Governmental
Council should be set up under Article 263.
2.  Article 356 (President’s Rule) should be used very sparingly, in
extreme cases as a last resort when all the available alternatives fail.
3.  The institution of All-India Services should be further strengthened
and some more such services should be created.
4.  The residuary powers of taxation should continue to remain with
the Parliament, while the other residuary powers should be placed in
the Concurrent List.
5.  When the president withholds his assent to the state bills, the
reasons should be communicated to the state government.
6.  The National Development Council (NDC) should be renamed and
reconstituted as the National Economic and Development Council
(NEDC).
7.  The zonal councils should be constituted afresh and reactivated to
promote the spirit of federalism.
8.  The Centre should have powers to deploy its armed forces, even
without the consent of states. However, it is desirable that the states
should be consulted.
9.  The Centre should consult the states before making a law on a
subject of the Concurrent List.
10.  The procedure of consulting the chief minister in the appointment
of the state governor should be prescribed in the Constitution itself.
11.  The net proceeds of the corporation tax may be made permissibly
shareable with the states.
12.  The governor cannot dismiss the council of ministers so long as it
commands a majority in the assembly.
13.  The governor’s term of five years in a state should not be
disturbed except for some extremely compelling reasons.
14.  No commission of enquiry should be set up against a state
minister unless a demand is made by the Parliament.
15.  The surcharge on income tax should not be levied by the Centre
except for a specific purpose and for a strictly limited period.
16.  The present division of functions between the Finance
Commission and the Planning Commission is reasonable and should
continue.
17.  Steps should be taken to uniformly implement the three language
formula in its true spirit.
18.  No autonomy for radio and television but decentralisation in their
operations.
19.  No change in the role of Rajya Sabha and Centre’s power to
reorganise the states.
20.  The commissioner for linguistic minorities should be activated.
The Central government has implemented 180 (out of 247)
recommendations of the Sarkaria Commission. The most important is the
establishment of the Inter-State Council in 1990.
Punchhi Commission
The Second commission on Centre-State Relations was set-up by the
Government of India in April 2007 under the Chairmanship of Madan
Mohan Punchhi, former Chief Justice of India.27
It was required to look into
the issues of Centre-State relations keeping in view the sea-changes that
have taken place in the polity and economy of India since the Sarkaria
Commission had last looked at the issue of Centre-State relations over two
decades ago.
The terms of reference of the Commission were as follows:
(i) The Commission was required to examine and review the
working of the existing arrangements between the Union and
States as per the Constitution of India, the healthy precedents
being followed, various pronouncements of the Courts in regard
to powers, functions and responsibilities in all spheres including
legislative relations, administrative relations, role of governors,
emergency provisions, financial relations, economic and social
planning, Panchayati Raj institutions, sharing of resources
including inter-state river water and recommend such changes or
other measures as may be appropriate keeping in view the
practical difficulties.
(ii) In examining and reviewing the working of the existing
arrangements between the Union and States and making
recommendations as to the changes and measures needed, the
Commission was required to keep in view the social and
economic developments that have taken place over the years,
particularly over the last two decades and have due regard to the
scheme and framework of the Constitution. Such
recommendations were also needed to address the growing
challenges of ensuring good governance for promoting the
welfare of the people whilst strengthening the unity and integrity
of the country, and of availing emerging opportunities for
sustained and rapid economic growth for alleviating poverty and
illiteracy in the early decades of the new millennium.
(iii) While examining and making its recommendations on the above,
the Commission was required to have particular regard, but not
limit its mandate to the following:-
(a)  The role, responsibility and jurisdiction of the Centre vis-a-vis
States during major and prolonged outbreaks of communal violence,
caste violence or any other social conflict leading to prolonged and
escalated violence.
(b)  The role, responsibility and jurisdiction of the Centre vis-a-vis
States in the planning and implementation of the mega projects like the
inter-linking of rivers, that would normally take 15–20 years for
completion and hinge vitally on the support of the States.
(c)  The role, responsibility and jurisdiction of the Centre vis-a-vis
States in promoting effective devolution of powers and autonomy to
Panchayati Raj Institutions and Local Bodies including the
Autonomous Bodies under the sixth Schedule of the Constitution
within a specified period of time.
(d)  The role, responsibility and jurisdiction of the Centre vis-a-vis
States in promoting the concept and practice of independent planning
and budgeting at the District level.
(e)  The role, responsibility and jurisdiction of the Centre vis-a-vis
States in linking Central assistance of various kinds with the
performance of the States.
(f)  The role, responsibility and jurisdiction of the Centre in adopting
approaches and policies based on positive discrimination in favour of
backward States.
(g)  The impact of the recommendations made by the 8
th
 to 12th Finance
Commissions on the fiscal relations between the Centre and the States,
especially the greater dependence of the States on devolution of funds
from the Centre.
(h)  The need and relevance of separate taxes on the production and on
the sales of goods and services subsequent to the introduction of Value
Added Tax regime.
(i)  The need for freeing inter-State trade in order to establish a unified
and integrated domestic market as also in the context of the reluctance
of State Governments to adopt the relevant Sarkaria Commission’s
recommendation in chapter XVIII of its report.
(j)  The need for setting up a Central Law Enforcement Agency
empowered to take up suo moto investigation of crimes having interState and/ or international ramifications with serious implications on
national security.
(k)  The feasibility of a supporting legislation under Article 355 for the
purpose of suo moto deployment of Central forces in the States if and
when the situation so demands.
The Commission submitted its report to the government in April 2010. In
finalising the 1,456 page report, in seven volumes, the Commission took
extensive help from the Sarkaria Commission report, the National
Commission to Review the Working of the Constitution (NCRWC) report
and the Second Administrative Reforms Commission report. However, in a
number of areas, the Commission report differed from the Sarkaria
Commission recommendations.
After examining at length the issues raised in its Terms of Reference and
the related aspects in all their hues and shades, the Commission came to the
conclusion that ‘cooperative federalism’ will be the key for sustaining
India’s unity, integrity and social and economic development in future. The
principles of cooperative federalism thus may have to act as a practical
guide for Indian polity and governance.
In all, the Commission made over 310 recommendations, touching upon
several significant areas in the working of Centre-state relations. The
important recommendations are mentioned below:
1.  To facilitate effective implementation of the laws on List III
subjects, it is necessary that some broad agreement is reached between
the Union and states before introducing legislation in Parliament on
matters in the Concurrent List.
2.  The Union should be extremely restrained in asserting
Parliamentary supremacy in matters assigned to the states. Greater
flexibility to states in relation to subjects in the State List and
“transferred items” in the Concurrent List is the key for better Centrestate relations.
3.  The Union should occupy only that many of subjects in concurrent
or overlapping jurisdiction which are absolutely necessary to achieve
uniformity of policy in demonstrable national interest.
4.  There should be a continuing auditing role for the Inter-state
Council in the management of matters in concurrent or overlapping
jurisdiction.
5.  The period of six months prescribed in Article 201 for State
Legislature to act when the bill is returned by the President can be
made applicable for the President also to decide on assenting or
withholding assent to a state bill reserved for consideration of the
President.
6.  Parliament should make a law on the subject of Entry 14 of List I
(treaty making and implementing it through Parliamentary legislation)
to streamline the procedures involved. The exercise of the power
obviously cannot be absolute or unchartered in view of the federal
structure of legislative and executive powers.
7.  Financial obligations and its implications on state finances arising
out of treaties and agreements should be a permanent term of reference
to the Finance Commissions constituted from time to time.
8.  While selecting Governors, the Central Government should adopt
the following strict guidelines as recommended in the Sarkaria
Commission report and follow its mandate in letter and spirit :
(i) He should be eminent in some walk of life
(ii) He should be a person from outside the state
(iii) He should be a detached figure and not too intimately
connected with the local politics of the state
(iv) He should be a person who has not taken too great a part in
politics generally and particularly in the recent past
9.  Governors should be given a fixed tenure of five years and their
removal should not be at the sweet will of the Government at the
Centre.
10.  The procedure laid down for impeachment of President, mutatis
mutandis can be made applicable for impeachment of Governors as
well.
11.  Article 163 does not give the Governor a general discretionary
power to act against or without the advice of his Council of Ministers.
In fact, the area for the exercise of discretion is limited and even in this
limited area, his choice of action should not be arbitrary or fanciful. It
must be a choice dictated by reason, activated by good faith and
tempered by caution.
12.  In respect of bills passed by the Legislative Assembly of a state,
the Governor should take the decision within six months whether to
grant assent or to reserve it for consideration of the President.
13.  On the question of Governor’s role in appointment of Chief
Minister in the case of an hung assembly, it is necessary to lay down
certain clear guidelines to be followed as Constitutional conventions.
These guidelines may be as follows:
(i) The party or combination of parties which commands the
widest support in the Legislative Assembly should be called
upon to form the Government.
(ii) If there is a pre-poll alliance or coalition, it should be treated
as one political party and if such coalition obtains a majority,
the leader of such coalition shall be called by the Governor
to form the Government.
(iii) In case no party or pre-poll coalition has a clear majority, the
Governor should select the Chief Minister in the order of
preference indicated here.
(a)  The group of parties which had pre-poll alliance commanding
the largest number
(b)  The largest single party staking a claim to form the
government with the support of others
(c)  A post-electoral coalition with all partners joining the
government
(d)  A post-electoral alliance with some parties joining the
government and the remaining including independents supporting
the government from outside
14.  On the question of dismissal of a Chief Minister, the Governor
should invariably insist on the Chief Minister proving his majority on
the floor of the House for which he should prescribe a time limit.
15.  The Governor should have the right to sanction for prosecution of
a state minister against the advice of the Council of Ministers, if the
Cabinet decision appears to the Governor to be motivated by bias in
the face of overwhelming material.
16.  The convention of Governors acting as Chancellors of Universities
and holding other statutory positions should be done away with. His
role should be confined to the Constitutional provisions only.
17.  When an external aggression or internal disturbance paralyses the
state administration creating a situation of a potential break down of
the Constitutional machinery of the state, all alternative courses
available to the Union for discharging its paramount responsibility
under Article 355 should be exhausted to contain the situation and the
exercise of the power under Article 356 should be limited strictly to
rectifying a “failure of the Constitutional machinery in the state”.
18.  On the question of invoking Article 356 in case of failure of
Constitutional machinery in states, suitable amendments are required
to incorporate the guidelines set forth in the landmark judgement of the
Supreme Court in S.R. Bommai V. Union of India (1994). This would
remove possible misgivings in this regard on the part of states and help
in smoothening Centre-state relations.
19.  Given the strict parameters now set for invoking the emergency
provisions under Articles 352 and 356 to be used only as a measure of
“last resort”, and the duty of the Union to protect states under Article
355, it is necessary to provide a Constitutional or legal framework to
deal with situations which require Central intervention but do not
warrant invoking the extreme steps under Articles 352 and 356.
Providing the framework for “localised emergency” would ensure that
the state government can continue to function and the Assembly would
not have to be dissolved while providing a mechanism to let the
Central Government respond to the issue specifically and locally. The
imposition of local emergency is fully justified under the mandate of
Article 355 read with Entry 2A of List I and Entry 1 of List II of the
Seventh Schedule.
20.  Suitable amendments to Article 263 are required to make the
Inter-State Council a credible, powerful and fair mechanism for
management of interstate and Centre-state differences.
21.  The Zonal Councils should meet at least twice a year with an
agenda proposed by states concerned to maximise co-ordination and
promote harmonisation of policies and action having inter-state
ramification. The Secretariat of a strengthened Inter-State Council can
function as the Secretariat of the Zonal Councils as well.
22.  The Empowered Committee of Finance Ministers of States proved
to be a successful experiment in inter-state coordination on fiscal
matters. There is need to institutionalise similar models in other sectors
as well. A forum of Chief Ministers, Chaired by one of the Chief
Minister by rotation can be similarly thought about particularly to coordinate policies of sectors like energy, food, education, environment
and health.
23.  New all-India services in sectors like health, education,
engineering and judiciary should be created.
24.  Factors inhibiting the composition and functioning of the Second
Chamber as a representative forum of states should be removed or
modified even if it requires amendment of the Constitutional
provisions. In fact, Rajya Sabha offers immense potential to negotiate
acceptable solutions to the friction points which emerge between
Centre and states in fiscal, legislative and administrative relations.
25.  A balance of power between states inter se is desirable and this is
possible by equality of representation in the Rajya Sabha. This requires
amendment of the relevant provisions to give equality of seats to states
in the Rajya Sabha, irrespective of their population size.
26.  The scope of devolution of powers to local bodies to act as
institutions of self-government should be constitutionally defined
through appropriate amendments.
27.  All future Central legislations involving states’ involvement
should provide for cost sharing as in the case of the RTE Act. Existing
Central legislations where the states are entrusted with the
responsibility of implementation should be suitably amended
providing for sharing of costs by the Central Government.
28.  The royalty rates on major minerals should be revised at least
every three years without any delay. States should be properly
compensated for any delay in the revision of royalty beyond three
years.
29.  The current ceiling on profession tax should be completely done
away with by a Constitutional amendment.
30.  The scope for raising more revenue from the taxes mentioned in
article 268 should be examined afresh. This issue may be either
referred to the next Finance Commission or an expert committee be
appointed to look into the matter.
31.  To bring greater accountability, all fiscal legislations should
provide for an annual assessment by an independent body and the
reports of these bodies should be laid in both Houses of
Parliament/state legislature.
32.  Considerations specified in the Terms of Reference (ToR) of the
Finance Commission should be even handed as between the Centre
and the states. There should be an effective mechanism to involve the
states in the finalisation of the ToR of the Finance Commissions.
33.  The Central Government should review all the existing cesses and
surcharges with a view to bringing down their share in the gross tax
revenue.
34.  Because of the close linkages between the plan and non-plan
expenditure, an expert committee may be appointed to look into the
issue of distinction between the plan and non-plan expenditure.
35.  There should be much better coordination between the Finance
Commission and the Planning Commission. The synchronisation of the
periods covered by the Finance Commission and the Five-Year Plan
will considerably improve such coordination.
36.  The Finance Commission division in the Ministry of Finance
should be converted into a full-fledged department, serving as the
permanent secretariat for the Finance Commissions.
37.  The Planning Commission has a crucial role in the current
situation. But its role should be that of coordination rather that of
micro managing sectoral plans of the Central ministries and the states.
38.  Steps should be taken for the setting up of an Inter-State Trade and
Commerce Commission under Article 307 read with Entry 42 of List-I.
This Commission should be vested with both advisory and executive
roles with decision making powers. As a Constitutional body, the
decisions of the Commission should be final and binding on all states
as well as the Union of India. Any party aggrieved with the decision of
the Commission may prefer an appeal to the Supreme Court.
The Report of the Commission was circulated to all stakeholders
including State Governments / UT Administrations and Union Ministries /
Departments concerned for their considered views on the recommendations
of the Commission. The comments received from the Union Ministries /
Departments and the State Governments / UT Administrations are under the
consideration of the Inter-State Council.28

15 Inter-State Relations
The successful functioning of the Indian federal system depends not only
on the harmonious relations and close cooperation between the Centre and
the states but also between the states inter se. Hence, the Constitution
makes the following provisions with regard to inter-state comity:
1.  Adjudication of inter-state water disputes.
2.  Coordination through inter-state councils.
3.  Mutual recognition of public acts, records and judicial proceedings.
4.  Freedom of inter-state trade, commerce and intercourse.
In addition, the zonal councils have been established by the Parliament to
promote inter-state cooperation and coordination.
INTER-STATE WATER DISPUTES
Article 262 of the Constitution provides for the adjudication of inter-state
water disputes. It makes two provisions:
(i) Parliament may by law provide for the adjudication of any dispute
or complaint with respect to the use, distribution and control of
waters of any inter-state river and river valley.
(ii) Parliament may also provide that neither the Supreme Court nor
any other court is to exercise jurisdiction in respect of any such
dispute or complaint.
Under this provision, the Parliament has enacted two laws [the River
Boards Act (1956) and the Inter-State Water Disputes Act (1956)]. The
River Boards Act provides for the establishment of river boards for the
regulation and development of inter-state river and river valleys. A river
board is established by the Central government on the request of the state
governments concerned to advise them.
The Inter-State Water Disputes Act empowers the Central government to
set up an ad hoc tribunal for the adjudication of a dispute between two or
more states in relation to the waters of an inter-state river or river valley.
The decision of the tribunal would be final and binding on the parties to the
dispute. Neither the Supreme Court nor any other court is to have
jurisdiction in respect of any water dispute which may be referred to such a
tribunal under this Act.
The need for an extra judicial machinery to settle inter-state water
disputes is as follows: “The Supreme Court would indeed have jurisdiction
to decide any dispute between states in connection with water supplies, if
legal rights or interests are concerned; but the experience of most countries
has shown that rules of law based upon the analogy of private proprietary
interests in water do not afford a satisfactory basis for settling disputes
between the states where the interests of the public at large in the proper use
of water supplies are involved.”1
So far (2019), the Central government has set up nine inter-state water
dispute tribunals. The name of the tribunals, the years in which they were
constituted and the states involved in the dispute are mentioned in Table
15.1.

INTER-STATE COUNCILS
Article 263 contemplates the establishment of an Inter-State Council to
effect coordination between the states and between Centre and states. Thus,
the President can establish such a council if at any time it appears to him
that the public interest would be served by its establishment. He can define
the nature of duties to be performed by such a council and its organisation
and procedure.
Even though the president is empowered to define the duties of an interstate council, Article 263 specifies the duties that can be assigned to it in the
following manner:
(a)  enquiring into and advising upon disputes which may arise
between states;
(b)  investigating and discussing subjects in which the states or the
Centre and the states have a common interest; and
(c)  making recommendations upon any such subject, and particularly
for the better co-ordination of policy and action on it.
“The council’s function to enquire and advice upon inter-state disputes is
complementary to the Supreme Court’s jurisdiction under Article 131 to
decide a legal controversy between the governments. The Council can deal
with any controversy whether legal or non-legal, but its function is advisory
unlike that of the court which gives a binding decision.”2
Under the above provisions of Article 263, the president has established
the following councils to make recommendations for the better coordination
of policy and action in the related subjects:
•  Central Council of Health and Family Welfare.
•  Central Council of Local Government3
•  Four Regional Councils for Sales Tax for the Northern, Eastern,
Western and Southern Zones.4
Establishment of Inter-State Council
The Sarkaria Commission on Centre-State Relations (1983–88) made a
strong case for the establishment of a permanent Inter-State Council under
Article 263 of the Constitution. It recommended that in order to
differentiate the Inter-State Council from other bodies established under the
same Article 263, it must be called as the Inter-Governmental Council. The
Commission recommended that the Council should be charged with the
duties laid down in clauses (b) and (c) of Article 263 (see above).
In pursuance of the above recommendations of the Sarkaria Commission,
the Janata Dal Government headed by V. P. Singh established the
Inter-State Council in 1990.
5
 It consists of the following members:
(i) Prime minister as the Chairman
(ii) Chief ministers of all the states
(iii) Chief ministers of union territories having legislative assemblies
(iv) Administrators of union territories not having legislative
assemblies
(v) Governors of States under President’s rule
(vi) Six Central cabinet ministers, including the home minister, to be
nominated by the Prime Minister.
Five Ministers of Cabinet rank / Minister of State (independent charge)
nominated by the Chairman of the Council (i.e., Prime Minister) are
permanent invitees to the Council.
The council is a recommendatory body on issues relating to inter-state,
Centre-state and Centre-union territories relations. It aims at promoting
coordination between them by examining, discussing and deliberating on
such issues. Its duties, in detail, are as follows:
•  investigating and discussing such subjects in which the states or the
centre have a common interest;
•  making recommendations upon any such subject for the better
coordination of policy and action on it; and
•  deliberating upon such other matters of general interest to the states
as may be referred to it by the chairman.
The Council may meet at least thrice in a year. Its meetings are held in
camera and all questions are decided by consensus.
There is also a Standing Committee of the Council. It was set up in 1996
for continuous consultation and processing of matters for the consideration
of the Council. It consists of the following members:
(i) Union Home Minister as the Chairman
(ii) Five Union Cabinet Ministers
(iii) Nine Chief Ministers
The Council is assisted by a secretariat called the Inter-State Council
Secretariat. This secretariat was set-up in 1991 and is headed by a secretary
to the Government of India. Since 2011, it is also functioning as the
secretariat of the Zonal Councils.
PUBLIC ACTS, RECORDS AND JUDICIAL
PROCEEDINGS
Under the Constitution, the jurisdiction of each state is confined to its own
territory. Hence, it is possible that the acts and records of one state may not
be recognised in another state. To remove any such difficulty, the
Constitution contains the “Full Faith and Credit” clause which lays down
the following:
(i) Full faith and credit is to be given throughout the territory of
India to public acts, records and judicial proceedings of the
Centre and every state. The expression ‘public acts’ includes both
legislative and executive acts of the government. The expression
‘public record’ includes any official book, register or record made
by a public servant in the discharge of his official duties.
(ii) The manner in which and the conditions under which such acts,
records and proceedings are to be proved and their effect
determined would be as provided by the laws of Parliament. This
means that the general rule mentioned above is subject to the
power of Parliament to lay down the mode of proof as well as the
effect of such acts, records and proceedings of one state in
another state.
(iii) Final judgements and orders of civil courts in any part of India
are capable of execution anywhere within India (without the
necessity of a fresh suit upon the judgement). The rule applies
only to civil judgements and not to criminal judgements. In other
words, it does not require the courts of a state to enforce the penal
laws of another state.
INTER-STATE TRADE AND COMMERCE
Articles 301 to 307 in Part XIII of the Constitution deal with the trade,
commerce and intercourse within the territory of India.
Article 301 declares that trade, commerce and intercourse throughout the
territory of India shall be free. The object of this provision is to break down
the border barriers between the states and to create one unit with a view to
encourage the free flow of trade, commerce and intercourse in the country.
The freedom under this provision is not confined to interstate trade,
commerce and intercourse but also extends to intra-state trade, commerce
and intercourse. Thus, Article 301 will be violated whether restrictions are
imposed at the frontier of any state or at any prior or subsequent stage.
The freedom guaranteed by Article 301 is a freedom from all restrictions,
except those which are provided for in the other provisions (Articles 302 to
305) of Part XIII of the Constitution itself. These are explained below:
(i) Parliament can impose restrictions on the freedom of trade,
commerce and intercourse between the states or within a
state in public interest.6 But, the Parliament cannot give
preference to one state over another or discriminate between
the states except in the case of scarcity of goods in any part
of India.
(ii) The legislature of a state can impose reasonable restrictions
on the freedom of trade, commerce and intercourse with that
state or within that state in public interest. But, a bill for this
purpose can be introduced in the legislature only with the
previous sanction of the president. Further, the state
legislature cannot give preference to one state over another
or discriminate between the states.
(iii) The legislature of a state can impose on goods imported
from other states or the union territories any tax to which
similar goods manufactured in that state are subject. This
provision prohibits the imposition of discriminatory taxes by
the state.
(iv) The freedom (under Article 301) is subject to the
nationalisation laws (i.e., laws providing for monopolies in
favour of the Centre or the states). Thus, the Parliament or
the state legislature can make laws for the carrying on by the
respective government of any trade, business, industry or
service, whether to the exclusion, complete or partial, of
citizens or otherwise.
The Parliament can appoint an appropriate authority for carrying out the
purposes of the above provisions relating to the freedom of trade,
commerce and intercourse and restrictions on it. The Parliament can also
confer on that authority the necessary powers and duties. But, no such
authority has been appointed so far.

ZONAL COUNCILS
The Zonal Councils are the statutory (and not the constitutional) bodies.
They are established by an Act of the Parliament, that is, States
Reorganisation Act of 1956. The act divided the country into five zones
(Northern, Central, Eastern, Western and Southern) and provided a zonal
council for each zone.
While forming these zones, several factors have been taken into account
which include: the natural divisions of the country, the river systems and
means of communication, the cultural and linguistic affinity and the
requirements of economic development, security and law and order.
Each zonal council consists of the following members: (a) home minister
of Central government. (b) chief ministers of all the States in the zone. (c)
Two other ministers from each state in the zone. (d) Administrator of each
union territory in the zone.
Besides, the following persons can be associated with the zonal council
as advisors (i.e., without the right to vote in the meetings):
(i) a person nominated by the Planning Commission; (ii) chief secretary
of the government of each state in the zone; and (iii) development
commissioner of each state in the zone.
The home minister of Central government is the common chairman of the
five zonal councils. Each chief minister acts as a vice-chairman of the
council by rotation, holding office for a period of one year at a time.
The zonal councils aim at promoting cooperation and coordination
between states, union territories and the Centre. They discuss and make
recommendations regarding matters like economic and social planning,
linguistic minorities, border disputes, interstate transport, and so on. They
are only deliberative and advisory bodies.
The objectives (or the functions) of the zonal councils, in detail, are as
follows:
•  To achieve an emotional integration of the country.
•  To help in arresting the growth of acute state-consciousness,
regionalism, lingu-ism and particularistic trends.
•  To help in removing the after-effects of separation in some cases so
that the process of reorganisation, integration and economic
advancement may synchronise.
•  To enable the Centre and states to cooperate with each other in social
and economic matters and exchange ideas and experience in order to
evolve uniform policies.
•  To cooperate with each other in the successful and speedy execution
of major development projects.
•  To secure some kind of political equilibrium between different
regions of the country.
North-Eastern Council In addition to the above Zonal Councils, a NorthEastern Council was created by a separate Act of Parliament– the NorthEastern Council Act of 1971.8
Its members include Assam, Manipur,
Mizoram, Arunchal Pradesh, Nagaland, Meghalaya, Tripura and Sikkim.9
Its functions are similar to those of the zonal councils, but with few
additions. It has to formulate a unified and coordinated regional plan
covering matters of common importance. It has to review from time to time
the measures taken by the member states for the maintenance of security
and public order in the region.

16 Emergency Provisions
The Emergency provisions are contained in Part XVIII of the Constitution,
from Articles 352 to 360. These provisions enable the Central government
to meet any abnormal situation effectively. The rationality behind the
incorporation of these provisions in the Constitution is to safeguard the
sovereignty, unity, integrity and security of the country, the democratic
political system, and the Constitution.
During an Emergency, the Central government becomes all powerful and
the states go into the total control of the Centre. It converts the federal
structure into a unitary one without a formal amendment of the
Constitution. This kind of transformation of the political system from
federal during normal times to unitary during Emergency is a unique feature
of the Indian Constitution. In this context, Dr. B.R. Ambedkar observed in
the Constituent Assembly that1
 :
‘All federal systems including American are placed in a tight mould
of federalism. No matter what the circumstances, it cannot change its
form and shape. It can never be unitary. On the other hand, the
Constitution of India can be both unitary as well as federal according
to the requirements of time and circumstances. In normal times, it is
framed to work as a federal system. But in times of Emergency, it is so
designed as to make it work as though it was a unitary system.’
The Constitution stipulates three types of emergencies:
1.  An emergency due to war, external aggression or armed rebellion2
(Article 352). This is popularly known as ‘National Emergency’.
However, the Constitution employs the expression ‘proclamation of
emergency’ to denote an emergency of this type.
2.  An Emergency due to the failure of the constitutional machinery in
the states (Article 356). This is popularly known as ‘President’s Rule’.
It is also known by two other names–‘State Emergency’ or
‘constitutional Emergency’. However, the Constitution does not use
the word ‘emergency’ for this situation.
3.  Financial Emergency due to a threat to the financial stability or
credit of India (Article 360).
NATIONAL EMERGENCY
Grounds of Declaration
Under Article 352, the President can declare a national emergency when the
security of India or a part of it is threatened by war or external aggression or
armed rebellion. It may be noted that the president can declare a national
emergency even before the actual occurrence of war or external aggression
or armed rebellion, if he is satisfied that there is an imminent danger.
The President can also issue different proclamations on grounds of war,
external aggression, armed rebellion, or imminent danger thereof, whether
or not there is a proclamation already issued by him and such proclamation
is in operation. This provision was added by the 38th Amendment Act of
1975.
When a national emergency is declared on the ground of ‘war’ or
‘external aggression’, it is known as ‘External Emergency’. On the other
hand, when it is declared on the ground of ‘armed rebellion’, it is known as
‘Internal Emergency’.
A proclamation of national emergency may be applicable to the entire
country or only a part of it. The 42nd Amendment Act of 1976 enabled the
president to limit the operation of a National Emergency to a specified part
of India.
Originally, the Constitution mentioned ‘internal disturbance’ as the third
ground for the proclamation of a National Emergency, but the expression
was too vague and had a wider connotation. Hence, the 44th Amendment
Act of 1978 substituted the words ‘armed rebellion’ for ‘internal
disturbance’. Thus, it is no longer possible to declare a National Emergency
on the ground of ‘internal disturbance’ as was done in 1975 by the Congress
government headed by Indira Gandhi.
The President, however, can proclaim a national emergency only after
receiving a written recommendation from the cabi-net3
. This means that the
emergency can be declared only on the concurrence of the cabinet and not
merely on the advice of the prime minister. In 1975, the then Prime
Minister, Indira Gandhi advised the president to proclaim emergency
without consulting her cabinet. The cabinet was informed of the
proclamation after it was made, as a fait accompli. The 44th Amendment
Act of 1978 introduced this safeguard to eliminate any possibility of the
prime minister alone taking a decision in this regard.
The 38th Amendment Act of 1975 made the declaration of a National
Emergency immune from the judicial review. But, this provision was
subsequently deleted by the 44th Amendment Act of 1978. Further, in the
Minerva Mills case4
, (1980), the Supreme Court held that the proclamation
of a national emergency can be challenged in a court on the ground of
malafide or that the declaration was based on wholly extraneous and
irrelevant facts or is absurd or perverse.
Parliamentary Approval and Duration
The proclamation of Emergency must be approved by both the Houses of
Parliament within one month from the date of its issue. Originally, the
period allowed for approval by the Parliament was two months, but was
reduced by the 44th Amendment Act of 1978. However, if the proclamation
of emergency is issued at a time when the Lok Sabha has been dissolved or
the dissolution of the Lok Sabha takes place during the period of one month
without approving the proclamation, then the proclamation survives until 30
days from the first sitting of the Lok Sabha after its reconstitution, provided
the Rajya Sabha has in the meantime approved it.
If approved by both the Houses of Parliament, the emergency continues
for six months, and can be extended to an indefinite period with an approval
of the Parliament for every six months. This provision for periodical
parliamentary approval was also added by the 44th Amendment Act of
1978. Before that, the emergency, once approved by the Parliament, could
remain in operation as long as the Executive (cabinet) desired. However, if
the dissolution of the Lok Sabha takes place during the period of six months
without approving the further continuance of Emergency, then the
proclamation survives until 30 days from the first sitting of the Lok Sabha
after its reconstitution, provided the Rajya Sabha has in the mean-time
approved its continuation.
Every resolution approving the proclamation of emergency or its
continuance must be passed by either House of Parliament by a special
majority, that is,
(a)  a majority of the total membership of that house, and (b) a
majority of not less than two-thirds of the members of that house
present and voting. This special majority provision was introduced by
the 44th Amendment Act of 1978. Previously, such resolution could be
passed by a simple majority of the Parliament.
Revocation of Proclamation
A proclamation of emergency may be revoked by the President at any time
by a subsequent proclamation. Such a proclamation does not require the
parliamentary approval.
Further, the President must revoke a proclamation if the Lok Sabha
passes a resolution disapproving its continuation. Again, this safeguard was
introduced by the 44th Amendment Act of 1978. Before the amendment, a
proclamation could be revoked by the president on his own and the Lok
Sabha had no control in this regard.
The 44th Amendment Act of 1978 also provided that, where one-tenth of
the total number of members of the Lok Sabha give a written notice to the
Speaker (or to the president if the House is not in session), a special sitting
of the House should be held within 14 days for the purpose of considering a
resolution disapproving the continuation of the proclamation.
A resolution of disapproval is different from a resolution approving the
continuation of a proclamation in the following two respects:
1.  The first one is required to be passed by the Lok Sabha only, while
the second one needs to be passed by the both Houses of Parliament.
2.  The first one is to be adopted by a simple majority only, while the
second one needs to be adopted by a special majority.
Effects of National Emergency
A proclamation of Emergency has drastic and wide ranging effects on the
political system. These consequences can be grouped into three categories:
1.  Effect on the Centre-state relations,
2.  Effect on the life of the Lok Sabha and State assembly, and
3.  Effect on the Fundamental Rights.
Effect on the Centre-State Relations
While a proclamation of Emergency is in force, the normal fabric of the
Centre-state relations undergoes a basic change. This can be studied under
three heads, namely, executive, legislative and financial.
(a) Executive During a national emergency, the executive power of the
Centre extends to directing any state regarding the manner in which its
executive power is to be exercised. In normal times, the Centre can give
executive directions to a state only on certain specified matters. However,
during a national emergency, the Centre becomes entitled to give executive
directions to a state on ‘any’ matter. Thus, the state governments are
brought under the complete control of the Centre, though they are not
suspended.
(b) Legislative During a national emergency, the Parliament becomes
empowered to make laws on any subject mentioned in the State List.
Although the legislative power of a state legislature is not suspended, it
becomes subject to the overriding power of the Parliament. Thus, the
normal distribution of the legislative powers between the Centre and states
is suspended, though the state Legislatures are not suspended. In brief, the
Constitution becomes unitary rather than federal.
The laws made by Parliament on the state subjects during a National
Emergency become inoperative six months after the emergency has ceased
to operate.
Notably, while a proclamation of national emergency is in operation, the
President can issue ordinances on the state subjects also, if the Parliament is
not in session.
Further, the Parliament can confer powers and impose duties upon the
Centre or its officers and authorities in respect of matters outside the Union
List, in order to carry out the laws made by it under its extended jurisdiction
as a result of the proclamation of a National Emergency.
The 42nd Amendment Act of 1976 provided that the two consequences
mentioned above (executive and legislative) extends not only to a state
where the Emergency is in operation but also to any other state.
(c) Financial While a proclamation of national emergency is in operation,
the President can modify the constitutional distribution of revenues between
the centre and the states. This means that the president can either reduce or
cancel the transfer of finances from Centre to the states. Such modification
continues till the end of the financial year in which the Emergency ceases to
operate. Also, every such order of the President has to be laid before both
the Houses of Parliament.
Effect on the Life of the Lok Sabha and State Assembly
While a proclamation of National Emergency is in operation, the life of the
Lok Sabha may be extended beyond its normal term (five years) by a law of
Parliament for one year at a time (for any length of time). However, this
extension cannot continue beyond a period of six months after the
emergency has ceased to operate. For example, the term of the Fifth Lok
Sabha (1971–1977) was extended two times by one year at a time5
 .
Similarly, the Parliament may extend the normal tenure of a state
legislative assembly (five years) by one year each time (for any length of
time) during a national emergency, subject to a maximum period of six
months after the Emergency has ceased to operate.
Effect on the Fundamental Rights
Articles 358 and 359 describe the effect of a National Emergency on the
Fundamental Rights. Article 358 deals with the suspension of the
Fundamental Rights guaranteed by Article 19, while Article 359 deals with
the suspension of other Fundamental Rights (except those guaranteed by
Articles 20 and 21). These two provisions are explained below:
(a) Suspension of Fundamental Rights under Article 19
According to Article 358, when a proclamation of national emergency is
made, the six Fundamental Rights under Article 19 are automatically
suspended. No separate order for their suspension is required.
While a proclamation of national emergency is in operation, the state is
freed from the restrictions imposed by Article 19. In other words, the state
can make any law or can take any executive action abridging or taking
away the six Fundamental Rights guaranteed by Article 19. Any such law
or executive action cannot be challenged on the ground that they are
inconsistent with the six Fundamental Rights guaranteed by Article 19.
When the National Emergency ceases to operate, Article 19 automatically
revives and comes into force. Any law made during Emergency, to the
extent of inconsistency with Article 19, ceases to have effect. However, no
remedy lies for anything done during the Emergency even after the
Emergency expires. This means that the legislative and executive actions
taken during the emergency cannot be challenged even after the Emergency
ceases to operate.
The 44th Amendment Act of 1978 restricted the scope of Article 358 in
two ways. Firstly, the six Fundamental Rights under Article 19 can be
suspended only when the National Emergency is declared on the ground of
war or external aggression and not on the ground of armed rebellion.
Secondly, only those laws which are related with the Emergency are
protected from being challenged and not other laws. Also, the executive
action taken only under such a law is protected.
(b) Suspension of other Fundamental Rights
Article 359 authorises the president to suspend the right to move any court
for the enforcement of Fundamental Rights during a National Emergency.
This means that under Article 359, the Fundamental Rights as such are not
suspended, but only their enforcement. The said rights are theoretically
alive but the right to seek remedy is suspended. The suspension of
enforcement relates to only those Fundamental Rights that are specified in
the Presidential Order. Further, the suspension could be for the period
during the operation of emergency or for a shorter period as mentioned in
the order, and the suspension order may extend to the whole or any part of
the country. It should be laid before each House of Parliament for approval.
While a Presidential Order is in force, the State can make any law or can
take any executive action abridging or taking away the specified
Fundamental Rights. Any such law or executive action cannot be
challenged on the ground that they are inconsistent with the specified
Fundamental Rights. When the Order ceases to operate, any law so made, to
the extent of inconsistency with the specified Fundamental Rights, ceases to
have effect. But no remedy lies for anything done during the operation of
the order even after the order ceases to operate. This means that the
legislative and executive actions taken during the operation of the Order
cannot be challenged even after the Order expires.
The 44th Amendment Act of 1978 restricted the scope of Article 359 in
two ways. Firstly, the President cannot suspend the right to move the Court
for the enforcement of fundamental rights guaranteed by Articles 20 to 21.
In other words, the right to protection in respect of conviction for offences
(Article 20) and the right to life and personal liberty (Article 21) remain
enforceable even during emergency. Secondly, only those laws which are
related with the emergency are protected from being challenged and not
other laws and the executive action taken only under such a law, is
protected.
Distinction Between Articles 358 and 359
The differences between Articles 358 and 359 can be summarised as
follows:
1.  Article 358 is confined to Fundamental Rights under Article 19
only whereas Article 359 extends to all those Fundamental Rights
whose enforcement is suspended by the Presidential Order.
2.  Article 358 automatically suspends the fundamental rights under
Article 19 as soon as the emergency is declared. On the other hand,
Article 359 does not automatically suspend any Fundamental Right. It
only empowers the president to suspend the enforcement of the
specified Fundamental Rights.
3.  Article 358 operates only in case of External Emergency (that is,
when the emergency is declared on the grounds of war or external
aggression) and not in the case of Internal Emergency (ie, when the
Emergency is declared on the ground of armed rebellion). Article 359,
on the other hand, operates in case of both External Emergency as well
as Internal Emergency.
4.  Article 358 suspends Fundamental Rights under Article 19 for the
entire duration of Emergency while Article 359 suspends the
enforcement of Fundamental Rights for a period specified by the
president which may either be the entire duration of Emergency or a
shorter period.
5.  Article 358 extends to the entire country whereas Article 359 may
extend to the entire country or a part of it.
6.  Article 358 suspends Article 19 completely while Article 359 does
not empower the suspension of the enforcement of Articles 20 and 21.
7.  Article 358 enables the State to make any law or take any executive
action inconsistent with Fundamental Rights under Article 19 while
Article 359 enables the State to make any law or take any executive
action inconsistent with those Fundamental Rights whose enforcement
is suspended by the Presidential Order.
There is also a similarity between Article 358 and Article 359. Both
provide immunity from challenge to only those laws which are related with
the Emergency and not other laws. Also, the executive action taken only
under such a law is protected by both.
Declarations Made So Far
This type of Emergency has been proclaimed three times so far–in 1962,
1971 and 1975.
The first proclamation of National Emergency was issued in October
1962 on account of Chinese aggression in the NEFA (North-East Frontier
Agency–now Arunachal Pradesh), and was in force till January 1968.
Hence, a fresh proclamation was not needed at the time of war against
Pakistan in 1965.
The second proclamation of national emergency was made in December
1971 in the wake of attack by Pakistan. Even when this Emergency was in
operation, a third proclamation of National Emergency was made in June
1975. Both the second and third proclamations were revoked in March
1977.
The first two proclamations (1962 and 1971) were made on the ground of
‘external aggression’, while the third proclamation (1975) was made on the
ground of ‘internal disturbance’, that is, certain persons have been inciting
the police and the armed forces against the discharge of their duties and
their normal functioning.
The Emergency declared in 1975 (internal emergency) proved to be the
most controversial. There was widespread criticism of the misuse of
Emergency powers. In the elections held to the Lok Sabha in 1977 after the
Emergency, the Congress Party led by Indira Gandhi lost and the Janta
Party came to power. This government appointed the Shah Commission to
investigate the circumstances that warranted the declaration of an
Emergency in 1975. The commission did not justify the declaration of the
Emergency. Hence, the 44th Amendment Act was enacted in 1978 to
introduce a number of safeguards against the misuse of Emergency
provisions.
PRESIDENT’S RULE
Grounds of Imposition
Article 355 imposes a duty on the Centre to ensure that the government of
every state is carried on in accordance with the provisions of the
Constitution. It is this duty in the performance of which the Centre takes
over the government of a state under Article 356 in case of failure of
constitutional machinery in state. This is popularly known as ‘President’s
Rule’. It is also known as ‘State Emergency’ or ‘Constitutional
Emergency’.
The President’s Rule can be proclaimed under Article 356 on two
grounds–one mentioned in Article 356 itself and another in Article 365:
1.  Article 356 empowers the President to issue a proclamation, if he is
satisfied that a situation has arisen in which the government of a state
cannot be carried on in accordance with the provisions of the
Constitution. Notably, the president can act either on a report of the
governor of the state or otherwise too (ie, even without the governor’s
report).
2.  Article 365 says that whenever a state fails to comply with or to
give effect to any direction from the Centre, it will be lawful for the
president to hold that a situation has arisen in which the government of
the state cannot be carried on in accordance with the provisions of the
Constitution.
Parliamentary Approval and Duration
A proclamation imposing President’s Rule must be approved by both the
Houses of Parliament within two months from the date of its issue.
However, if the proclamation of President’s Rule is issued at a time when
the Lok Sabha has been dissolved or the dissolution of the Lok Sabha takes
place during the period of two months without approving the proclamation,
then the proclamation survives until 30 days from the first sitting of the Lok
Sabha after its reconstitution, provided the Rajya Sabha approves it in the
mean time.
If approved by both the Houses of Parliament, the President’s Rule
continues for six months6
. It can be extended for a maximum period of three
years7 with the approval of the Parliament, every six months. However, if
the dissolution of the Lok Sabha takes place during the period of six months
without approving the further continuation of the President’s Rule, then the
proclamation survives until 30 days from the first sitting of the Lok Sabha
after its reconstitution, provided the Rajya Sabha has in the meantime
approved its continuance.
Every resolution approving the proclamation of President’s Rule or its
continuation can be passed by either House of Parliament only by a simple
majority, that is, a majority of the members of that House present and
voting.
The 44th Amendment Act of 1978 introduced a new provision to put
restraint on the power of Parliament to extend a proclamation of President’s
Rule beyond one year. Thus, it provided that, beyond one year, the
President’s Rule can be extended by six months at a time only when the
following two conditions are fulfilled:
1.  a proclamation of National Emergency should be in operation in the
whole of India, or in the whole or any part of the state; and
2.  the Election Commission must certify that the general elections to
the legislative assembly of the concerned state cannot be held on
account of difficulties.
A proclamation of President’s Rule may be revoked by the President at
any time by a subsequent proclamation. Such a proclamation does not
require the parliamentary approval.
Consequences of President’s Rule
The President acquires the following extraordinary powers when the
President’s Rule is imposed in a state:
1.  He can take up the functions of the state government and powers
vested in the governor or any other executive authority in the state.
2.  He can declare that the powers of the state legislature are to be
exercised by the Parliament.
3.  He can take all other necessary steps including the suspension of
the constitutional provisions relating to any body or authority in the
state.
Therefore, when the President’s Rule is imposed in a state, the President
dismisses the state council of ministers headed by the chief minister. The
state governor, on behalf of the President, carries on the state administration
with the help of the chief secretary of the state or the advisors appointed by
the President. This is the reason why a proclamation under Article 356 is
popularly known as the imposition of ‘President’s Rule’ in a state. Further,
the President either suspends or dissolves the state legislative assembly8
.
The Parliament passes the state legislative bills and the state budget.
When the state legislature is thus suspended or dissolved:
1.  the Parliament can delegate the power to make laws for the state to
the President or to any other authority specified by him in this regard,
2.  the Parliament or in case of delegation, the President or any other
specified authority can make laws conferring powers and imposing
duties on the Centre or its officers and authorities,
3.  the President can authorise, when the Lok Sabha is not in session,
expenditure from the state consolidated fund pending its sanction by
the Parliament, and
4.  the President can promulgate, when the Parliament is not in session,
ordinances for the governance of the state.
A law made by the Parliament or president or any other specified
authority continues to be operative even after the President’s Rule. This
means that the period for which such a law remains in force is not
coterminous with the duration of the proclamation. But it can be repealed or
altered or re-enacted by the state legislature.
It should be noted here that the President cannot assume to himself the
powers vested in the concerned state high court or suspend the provisions of
the Constitution relating to it. In other words, the constitutional position,
status, powers and functions of the concerned state high court remain same
even during the President’s Rule.
Use of Article 356
Since 1950, the President’s Rule has been imposed on more than 125
occasions, that is, on an average twice a year. Further, on a number of
occasions, the President’s Rule has been imposed in an arbitrary manner for
political or personal reasons. Hence, Article 356 has become one of the
most controversial and most criticised provision of the Constitution.
Table 16.1  Comparing National Emergency and President’s Rule
National Emergency
(Article 352)
President’s Rule (Article 356)
1.  It can be proclaimed
only when the security of
India or a part of it is
threatened by war, external
aggression or armed
rebellion.
1.  It can be proclaimed when the
government of a state cannot be
carried on in accordance with the
provisions of the Constitution due to
reasons which may not have any
connection with war, external
aggression or armed rebellion.
2.  During its operation,
the state executive and
legislature continue to
function and exercise the
powers assigned to them
under the Constitution. Its
effect is that the Centre
gets concurrent powers of
administration and
legislation in the state.
2.  During its operation, the state
executive is dismissed and the state
legislature is either suspended or
dissolved. The president administers
the state through the governor and
the Parliament makes laws for the
state. In brief, the executive and
legislative powers of the state are
assumed by the Centre.
3.  Under this, the
Parliament can make laws
on the subjects enumerated
in the State List only by
itself, that is, it cannot
delegate the same to any
other body or authority.
3.  Under this, the Parliament can
delegate the power to make laws for
the state to the President or to any
other authority specified by him. So
far, the practice has been for the
president to make laws for the state
in consultation with the members of
Parliament from that state. Such laws
are known as President’s Acts.
4.  There is no maximum
period prescribed for its
operation. It can be
continued indefinitely with
the approval of Parliament
for every six months.
4.  There is a maximum period
prescribed for its operation, that is,
three years. Thereafter, it must come
to an end and the normal
constitutional machinery must be
restored in the state.
5.  Under this, the
relationship of the Centre
with all the states
undergoes a modification.
5.  Under this, the relationship of
only the state under emergency with
the Centre undergoes a modification.
6.  Every resolution of
Parliament approving its
proclamation or its
continuance must be
passed by a special
majority.
6.  Every resolution of Parliament
approving its proclamation or its
continuance can be passed only by a
simple majority.
7.  It affects fundamental
rights of the citizens.
7.  It has no effect on Fundamental
Rights of the citizens.
8.  Lok Sabha can pass a
resolution for its
revocation.
8.  There is no such provision. It can
be revoked by the President only on
his own.
For the first time, the President’s Rule was imposed in Punjab in 1951.
By now, all most all the states have been brought under the President’s
Rule, once or twice or more. The details in this regard are given in Table
16.2 at the end of this chapter.
When general elections were held to the Lok Sabha in 1977 after the
internal emergency, the ruling Congress Party lost and the Janta Party came
to power. The new government headed by Morarji Desai imposed
President’s Rule in nine states9
(where the Congress Party was in power) on
the ground that the assemblies in those states no longer represented the
wishes of the electorate. When the Congress Party returned to power in
1980, it did the same in nine states10
 on the same ground.
In 1992, President’s Rule was imposed in three BJP-ruled states (Madhya
Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and Rajasthan) by the Congress Party on the
ground that they were not implementing sincerely the ban imposed by the
Centre on religious organisations. In a landmark judgement in Bommai
case11
(1994), the Supreme Court upheld the validity of this proclamation on
the ground that secularism is a ‘basic feature’ of the Constitution. But, the
court did not uphold the validity of the imposition of the President’s Rule in
Nagaland in 1988, Karnataka in 1989 and Meghalaya in 1991.
Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, while replying to the critics of this provision in the
Constituent Assembly, hoped that the drastic power conferred by Article
356 would remain a ‘deadletter’ and would be used only as a measure of
last resort. He observed12
 :
“The intervention of the Centre must be deemed to be barred, because
that would be an invasion on the sovereign authority of the province
(state). That is a fundamental proposition which we must accept by
reason of the fact that we have a Federal Constitution. That being so, if
the Centre is to interfere in the administration of provincial affairs, it
must be under some obligation which the Constitution imposes upon
the Centre. The proper thing we ought to expect is that such Articles
will never be called into operation and that they would remain a deadletter. If at all they are brought into operation, I hope the President who
is endowed with this power will take proper precautions before
actually suspending the administration of the province.”
However, the subsequent events show that what was hoped to be a ‘deadletter’ of the Constitution has turned to be a ‘deadly-weapon’ against a
number of state governments and legislative assemblies. In this context,
H.V. Kamath, a member of the Constituent Assembly commented a decade
ago: ‘Dr. Ambedkar is dead and the Articles are very much alive’.
Scope of Judicial Review
The 38th Amendment Act of 1975 made the satisfaction of the President in
invoking Article 356 final and conclusive which could not be challenged in
any court on any ground. But, this provision was subsequently deleted by
the 44th Amendment Act of 1978 implying that the satisfaction of the
President is not beyond judicial review.
In Bommai case (1994), the following propositions have been laid down
by the Supreme Court on imposition of President’s Rule in a state under
Article 356:
1.  The presidential proclamation imposing President’s Rule is subject
to judicial review.
2.  The satisfaction of the President must be based on relevant
material. The action of the president can be struck down by the court if
it is based on irrelevant or extraneous grounds or if it was found to be
malafide or perverse.
3.  Burden lies on the Centre to prove that relevant material exist to
justify the imposition of the President’s Rule.
4.  The court cannot go into the correctness of the material or its
adequacy but it can see whether it is relevant to the action.
5.  If the court holds the presidential proclamation to be
unconstitutional and invalid, it has power to restore the dismissed state
government and revive the state legislative assembly if it was
suspended or dissolved.
6.  The state legislative assembly should be dissolved only after the
Parliament has approved the presidential proclamation. Until such
approval is given, the president can only suspend the assembly. In case
the Parliament fails to approve the proclamation, the assembly would
get reactivated.
7.  Secularism is one of the ‘basic features’ of the Constitution. Hence,
a state government pursuing anti-secular politics is liable to action
under Article 356.
8.  The question of the state government losing the confidence of the
legislative assembly should be decided on the floor of the House and
until that is done the ministry should not be unseated.
9.  Where a new political party assumes power at the Centre, it will not
have the authority to dismiss ministries formed by other parties in the
states.
10.  The power under Article 356 is an exceptional power and should
be used only occassionally to meet the requirements of special
situations.
Cases of Proper and Improper Use
Based on the report of the Sarkaria Commission on Centre-state Relations
(1988), the Supreme Court in Bommai case (1994) enlisted the situations
where the exercise of power under Article 356 could be proper or improper13
.
Imposition of President’s Rule in a state would be proper in the following
situations:
1.  Where after general elections to the assembly, no party secures a
majority, that is, ‘Hung Assembly’.
2.  Where the party having a majority in the assembly declines to form
a ministry and the governor cannot find a coalition ministry
commanding a majority in the assembly.
3.  Where a ministry resigns after its defeat in the assembly and no
other party is willing or able to form a ministry commanding a
majority in the assembly.
4.  Where a constitutional direction of the Central government is
disregarded by the state government.
5.  Internal subversion where, for example, a government is
deliberately acting against the Constitution and the law or is fomenting
a violent revolt.
6.  Physical breakdown where the government wilfully refuses to
discharge its constitutional obligations endangering the security of the
state.
The imposition of President’s Rule in a state would be improper under
the following situations:
1.  Where a ministry resigns or is dismissed on losing majority support
in the assembly and the governor recommends imposition of
President’s Rule without probing the possibility of forming an
alternative ministry.
2.  Where the governor makes his own assessment of the support of a
ministry in the assembly and recommends imposition of President’s
Rule without allowing the ministry to prove its majority on the floor of
the Assembly.
3.  Where the ruling party enjoying majority support in the assembly
has suffered a massive defeat in the general elections to the Lok Sabha
such as in 1977 and 1980.
4.  Internal disturbances not amounting to internal subversion or
physical breakdown.
5.  Maladministration in the state or allegations of corruption against
the minis-tryor stringent financial exigencies of the state.
6.  Where the state government is not given prior warning to rectify
itself except in case of extreme urgency leading to disastrous
consequences.
7.  Where the power is used to sort out intraparty problems of the
ruling party, or for a purpose extraneous or irrelevant to the one for
which it has been conferred by the Constitution.
FINANCIAL EMERGENCY
Grounds of Declaration
Article 360 empowers the president to proclaim a Financial Emergency if
he is satisfied that a situation has arisen due to which the financial stability
or credit of India or any part of its territory is threatened.
The 38th Amendment Act of 1975 made the satisfaction of the president
in declaring a Financial Emergency final and conclusive and not
questionable in any court on any ground. But, this provision was
subsequently deleted by the 44th Amendment Act of 1978 implying that the
satisfaction of the president is not beyond judicial review.
Parliamentary Approval and Duration
A proclamation declaring financial emergency must be approved by both
the Houses of Parliament within two months from the date of its issue.
However, if the proclamation of Financial Emergency is issued at a time
when the Lok Sabha has been dissolved or the dissolution of the Lok Sabha
takes place during the period of two months without approving the
proclamation, then the proclamation survives until 30 days from the first
sitting of the Lok Sabha after its reconstitution, provided the Rajya Sabha
has in the meantime approved it.
Once approved by both the Houses of Parliament, the Financial
Emergency continues indefinitely till it is revoked. This implies two things:
1.  there is no maximum period prescribed for its operation; and
2.  repeated parliamentary approval is not required for its continuation.
A resolution approving the proclamation of financial emergency can be
passed by either House of Parliament only by a simple majority, that is, a
majority of the members of that house present and voting.
A proclamation of Financial Emergency may be revoked by the president
at anytime by a subsequent proclamation. Such a proclamation does not
require the parliamentary approval.
Effects of Financial Emergency
The consequences of the proclamation of a Financial Emergency are as
follows:
1.  The executive authority of the Centre extends to the giving of (a)
directions to any state to observe such canons of financial propriety as
may be specified in the directions; and (b) such other directions to any
state as the President may deem necessary and adequate for the
purpose.
2.  Any such direction may include a provision requiring (a) the
reduction of salaries and allowances of all or any class of persons
serving in the state; and (b) the reservation of all money bills or other
financial bills for the consideration of the President after they are
passed by the legislature of the state.
3.  The President may issue directions for the reduction of salaries and
allowances of (a) all or any class of persons serving the Union; and (b)
the judges of the Supreme Court and the high court.
Thus, during the operation of a financial emergency, the Centre acquires
full control over the states in financial matters. H.N. Kunzru, a member of
the Constituent Assembly, stated that the financial emergency provisions
pose a serious threat to the financial autonomy of the states. Explaining the
reasons for their inclusion in the Constitution, Dr. B.R. Ambedkar observed
in the Constituent Assembly14
 :
“This Article more or less follows the pattern of what is called the
National Recovery Act of the United States passed in 1933, which gave the
president power to make similar provisions in order to remove the
difficulties, both economical and financial, that had overtaken the American
people, as a result of the Great Depression.”
No Financial Emergency has been declared so far, though there was a
financial crisis in 1991.
CRITICISM OF THE EMERGENCY PROVISIONS
Some members of the Constituent Assembly criticised the incorporation of
emergency provisions in the Constitution on the following grounds15
 :
1.  ‘The federal character of the Constitution will be destroyed and the
Union will become all powerful.
2.  The powers of the State–both the Union and the units–will entirely
be concentrated in the hands of the Union executive.
3.  The President will become a dictator.
4.  The financial autonomy of the state will be nullified.
5.  Fundamental rights will become meaningless and, as a result, the
democratic foundations of the Constitution will be destroyed.’
Thus, H.V. Kamath observed: ‘I fear that by this single chapter we are
seeking to lay the foundation of a totalitarian state, a police state, a state
completely opposed to all the ideals and principles that we have held aloft
during the last few decades, a State where the rights and liberties of
millions of innocent men and women will be in continuous jeopardy, a State
where if there be peace, it will be the peace of the grave and the void of the
desert(. . .) It will be a day of shame and sorrow when the President makes
use of these Powers having no parallel in any Constitution of the
democratic countries of the world’16
 .
K.T. Shah described them as: ‘A chapter of reaction and retrogression. (. .
.) I find one cannot but notice two distinct currents of thought underlying
and influencing throughout the provisions of this chapter: (a) to arm the
Centre with special powers against the units and (b) to arm the government
against the people . . . Looking at all the provisions of this chapter
particularly and scrutinising the powers that have been given in almost
every article, it seems to me, the name only of liberty or democracy will
remain under the Constitution’.
T.T. Krishnamachari feared that ‘by means of these provisions the
President and the Executive would be exercising a form of constitutional
dictatorship’17
 .
H.N. Kunzru opined that ‘the emergency financial provisions pose a
serious threat to the financial autonomy of the States.’
However, there were also protagonists of the emergency provisions in the
Constituent Assembly. Thus, Sir Alladi Krishnaswami Ayyar labelled them
as ‘the very life-breath of the Constitution’. Mahabir Tyagi opined that they
would work as a ‘safety-valve’ and thereby help in the maintenance of the
Constitution18
 .
While defending the emergency provisions in the Constituent Assembly,
Dr. B.R. Ambedkar also accepted the possibility of their misuse. He
observed, ‘I do not altogether deny that there is a possibility of the Articles
being abused or employed for political purposes’19

NOTES AND REFERENCES
1.  Constituent Assembly Debates, Volume VII, p. 34.
2.  The phrase ‘armed rebellion’ was inserted by the 44th Amendment
Act of 1978, replacing the original phrase ‘internal disturbance’.
3.  Article 352 defines the term ‘Cabinet’ as the council consisting of
the Prime Minister and other ministers of the Cabinet rank.
4.  Minerva Mills v. Union of India, (1980).
5.  The term of the Fifth Lok Sabha which was to expire on 18 March,
1976 was extended by one year upto 18 March, 1977 by the House of
the People (Extension of Duration) Act, 1976. It was extend for a
further period of one year upto 18 March, 1978 by the House of the
People (Extension of Duration) Amendment Act, 1976. However, the
House was dissolved on 18 January, 1977, after having been in
existence for a period of five years, ten months and six days.
6.  The 42nd Amendment Act of 1976 had raised the period of six
months to one year. Thus, once approved by both the Houses of
Parliament, the proclamation of President’s Rule could continue for
one year. But, the 44th Amendment Act of 1978 again reduced the

Articles 52 to 78 in Part V of the Constitution deal with the Union
executive.
The Union executive consists of the President, the Vice-President, the
Prime Minister, the council of ministers and the attorney general of India.
The President is the head of the Indian State. He is the first citizen of
India and acts as the symbol of unity, integrity and solidarity of the nation.
ELECTION OF THE PRESIDENT
The President is elected not directly by the people but by members of
electoral college consisting of:
1.  the elected members of both the Houses of Parliament;
2.  the elected members of the legislative assemblies of the states; and
3.  the elected members of the legislative assemblies of the Union
Territories of Delhi and Puducherry1
 .
Thus, the nominated members of both of Houses of Parliament, the
nominated members of the state legislative assemblies, the members (both
elected and nominated) of the state legislative councils (in case of the
bicameral legislature) and the nominated members of the Legislative
Assemblies of Delhi and Puducherry do not participate in the election of the
President. Where an assembly is dissolved, the members cease to be
qualified to vote in presidential election, even if fresh elections to the
dissolved assembly are not held before the presidential election.
The Constitution provides that there shall be uniformity in the scale of
representation of different states as well as parity between the states as a
whole and the Union at the election of the President. To achieve this, the
number of votes which each elected member of the legislative assembly of
each state and the Parliament is entitled to cast at such election shall be
determined in the following manner:
1.  Every elected member of the legislative assembly of a state shall
have as many votes as there are multiples of one thousand in the
quotient obtained by dividing the population of the state by the total
number of the elected members of the assembly2
. This can be
expressed as:
2.  Every elected member of either House of Parliament shall have
such number of votes as may be obtained by dividing the total number
of votes assigned to members of the legislative assemblies of the states
by the total number of the elected members of both the Houses of
Parliament. This can be expressed as:
The President’s election is held in accordance with the system of
proportional representation by means of the single transferable vote and the
voting is by secret ballot. This system ensures that the successful candidate
is returned by the absolute majority of votes. A candidate, in order to be
declared elected to the office of President, must secure a fixed quota of
votes. The quota of votes is determined by dividing the total number of
valid votes polled by the number of candidates to be elected (here only one
candidate is to be elected as President) plus one and adding one to the
quotient. The formula can be expressed as:
Each member of the electoral college is given only one ballot paper. The
voter, while casting his vote, is required to indicate his preferences by
marking 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. against the names of candidates. This means that the
voter can indicate as many preferences as there are candidates in the fray.
In the first phase, the first preference votes are counted. In case a
candidate secures the required quota in this phase, he is declared elected.
Otherwise, the process of transfer of votes is set in motion. The ballots of
the candidate securing the least number of first preference votes are
cancelled and his second preference votes are transferred to the first
preference votes of other candidates. This process continues till a candidate
secures the required quota.
All doubts and disputes in connection with election of the President are
inquired into and decided by the Supreme Court whose decision is final.
The election of a person as President cannot be challenged on the ground
that the electoral college was incomplete (ie, existence of any vacancy
among the members of electoral college). If the election of a person as
President is declared void by the Supreme Court, acts done by him before
the date of such declaration of the Supreme Court are not invalidated and
continue to remain in force.
Some members of the Constituent Assembly criticised the system of
indirect election for the President as undemocratic and proposed the idea of
direct election. However, the Constitution makers chose the indirect
election due to the following reasons3
 :
1.  The indirect election of the President is in harmony with the
parliamentary system of government envisaged in the Constitution.
Under this system, the President is only a nominal executive and the
real powers are vested in the council of ministers headed by the prime
minister. It would have been anomalous to have the President elected
directly by the people and not give him any real power.
2.  The direct election of the President would have been very costly
and time- and energy-consuming due to the vast size of the electorate.
This is unwarranted keeping in view that he is only a symbolic head.
Some members of the Constituent Assembly suggested that the President
should be elected by the members of the two Houses of Parliament alone.
The makers of the Constitution did not prefer this as the Parliament,
dominated by one political party, would have invariably chosen a candidate
from that party and such a President could not represent the states of the
Indian Union. The present system makes the President a representative of
the Union and the states equally.
Further, it was pointed out in the Constituent Assembly that the
expression ‘proportional representation’ in the case of presidential election
is a misnomer. Proportional representation takes place where two or more
seats are to be filled. In case of the President, the vacancy is only one. It
could better be called a preferential or alternative vote system. Similarly,
the expression ‘single transferable vote’ was also objected on the ground
that no voter has a single vote; every voter has plural votes.
QUALIFICATIONS, OATH AND CONDITIONS
Qualifications for Election as President
A person to be eligible for election as President should fulfil the following
qualifications:
1.  He should be a citizen of India.
2.  He should have completed 35 years of age.
3.  He should be qualified for election as a member of the Lok Sabha.
4.  He should not hold any office of profit under the Union government
or any state government or any local authority or any other public
authority. A sitting President or VicePresident of the Union, the
Governor of any state and a minister of the Union or any state is not
deemed to hold any office of profit and hence qualified as a
presidential candidate.
Further, the nomination of a candidate for election to the office of
President must be subscribed by at least 50 electors as proposers and 50
electors as seconders. Every candidate has to make a security deposit of
₹15,000 in the Reserve Bank of India. The security deposit is liable to be
forfeited in case the candidate fails to secure one-sixth of the votes polled.
Before 1997, number of proposers and seconders was ten each and the
amount of security deposit was ₹2,500. In 1997, they were increased to
discourage the non-serious candidates4
 .
Oath or Affirmation by the President
Before entering upon his office, the President has to make and subscribe to
an oath or affirmation. In his oath, the President swears:
1.  to faithfully execute the office;
2.  to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution and the law; and
3.  to devote himself to the service and well-being of the people of
India.

The oath of office to the President is administered by the Chief Justice of
India and in his absence, the seniormost judge of the Supreme Court
available.
Any other person acting as President or discharging the functions of the
President also undertakes the similar oath or affirmation.
Conditions of President’s Office
The Constitution lays down the following conditions of the President’s
office:
1.  He should not be a member of either House of Parliament or a
House of the state legislature. If any such person is elected as
President, he is deemed to have vacated his seat in that House on the
date on which he enters upon his office as President.
2.  He should not hold any other office of profit.
3.  He is entitled, without payment of rent, to the use of his official
residence (the Rastrapathi Bhavan).
4.  He is entitled to such emoluments, allowances and privileges as
may be determined by Parliament.
5.  His emoluments and allowances cannot be diminished during his
term of office.
In 2018, the Parliament increased the salary of the President from ₹1.50
lakh to ₹5 lakh per month4a
. Earlier in 2008, the pension of the retired
President was increased from ₹3 lakh per annum to 50% of his salary per
month5
. In addition, the former Presidents are entitled to furnished
residence, phone facilities, car, medical treatment, travel facility, secretarial
staff and office expenses upto ₹1,00,000 per annum. The spouse of a
deceased President is also entitled to a family pension at the rate of 50% of
pension of a retired President, furnished residence, phone facility, car,
medical treatment, travel facility, secretarial staff and office expenses upto
₹20,000 per annum.
The President is entitled to a number of privileges and immunities. He
enjoys personal immunity from legal liability for his official acts. During
his term of office, he is immune from any criminal proceedings, even in
respect of his personal acts. He cannot be arrested or imprisoned. However,
after giving two months’ notice, civil proceedings can be instituted against
him during his term of office in respect of his personal acts.
TERM, IMPEACHMENT AND VACANCY
Term of President’s Office
The President holds office for a term of five years from the date on which
he enters upon his office. However, he can resign from his office at any
time by addressing the resignation letter to the Vice-President. Further, he
can also be removed from the office before completion of his term by the
process of impeachment.
The President can hold office beyond his term of five years until his
successor assumes charge. He is also eligible for re-election to that office.
He may be elected for any number of terms6
. However, in USA, a person
cannot be elected to the office of the President more than twice.
Impeachment of President
The President can be removed from office by a process of impeachment for
‘violation of the Constitution’. However, the Constitution does not define
the meaning of the phrase ‘violation of the Constitution’.
The impeachment charges can be initiated by either House of Parliament.
These charges should be signed by one-fourth members of the House (that
framed the charges), and a 14 days’ notice should be given to the President.
After the impeachment resolution is passed by a majority of two-thirds of
the total membership of that House, it is sent to the other House, which
should investigate the charges. The President has the right to appear and to
be represented at such investigation. If the other House also sustains the
charges and passes the impeachment resolution by a majority of two-thirds
of the total membership, then the President stands removed from his office
from the date on which the resolution is so passed.
Thus, an impeachment is a quasi-judicial procedure in the Parliament. In
this context, two things should be noted: (a) the nominated members of
either House of Parliament can participate in the impeachment of the
President though they do not participate in his election; (b) the elected
members of the legislative assemblies of states and the Union Territories of
Delhi and Puducherry do not participate in the impeachment of the
President though they participate in his election.
No President has so far been impeached.
Vacancy in the President’s Office
A vacancy in the President’s office can occur in any of the following ways:
1.  On the expiry of his tenure of five years.
2.  By his resignation.
3.  On his removal by the process of impeachment.
4.  By his death7
 .
5.  Otherwise, for example, when he becomes disqualified to hold
office or when his election is declared void.
When the vacancy is going to be caused by the expiration of the term of
the sitting President, an election to fill the vacancy must be held before the
expiration of the term. In case of any delay in conducting the election of
new President by any reason, the outgoing President continues to hold
office (beyond his term of five years) until his successor assumes charge.
This is provided by the Constitution in order to prevent an ‘interregnum’. In
this situation, the VicePresident does not get the opportunity to act as
President or to discharge the functions of the President.
If the office falls vacant by resignation, removal, death or otherwise, then
election to fill the vacancy should be held within six months from the date
of the occurrence of such a vacancy. The newly-elected President remains
in office for a full term of five years from the date he assumes charge of his
office.
When a vacancy occurs in the office of the President due to his
resignation, removal, death or otherwise, the Vice-President acts as the
President until a new President is elected. Further, when the sitting
President is unable to discharge his functions due to absence, illness or any
other cause, the Vice-President discharges his functions until the President
resumes his office.
In case the office of Vice-President is vacant, the Chief Justice of India
(or if his office is also vacant, the seniormost judge of the Supreme Court
available) acts as the President or discharges the functions of the President8
 .
When any person, ie, Vice-President, chief justice of India, or the
seniormost judge of the Supreme Court is acting as the President or
discharging the functions of the President, he enjoys all the powers and
immunities of the President and is entitled to such emoluments, allowances
and privileges as are determined by the Parliament.

Emergency Powers
In addition to the normal powers mentioned above, the Constitution confers
extraordinary powers on the President to deal with the following three types

 :
(a)  National Emergency (Article 352);
(b)  President’s Rule (Article 356 & 365); and
(c)  Financial Emergency (Article 360)
VETO POWER OF THE PRESIDENT
A bill passed by the Parliament can become an act only if it receives the
assent of the President. When such a bill is presented to the President for his
assent, he has three alternatives (under Article 111 of the Constitution):
1.  He may give his assent to the bill, or
2.  He may withhold his assent to the bill, or
3.  He may return the bill (if it is not a Money bill) for reconsideration
of the Parliament. However, if the bill is passed again by the
Parliament with or without amendments and again presented to the
President, the President must give his assent to the bill.
Thus, the President has the veto power over the bills passed by the
Parliament10
, that is, he can withhold his assent to the bills. The object of
conferring this power on the President is two-fold–(a) to prevent hasty and
ill-considered legislation by the Parliament; and (b) to prevent a legislation
which may be unconstitutional.
The veto power enjoyed by the executive in modern states can be
classified into the following four types:
1.  Absolute veto, that is, withholding of assent to the bill passed by
the legislature.
2.  Qualified veto, which can be overridden by the legislature with a
higher majority.
3.  Suspensive veto, which can be overridden by the legislature with an
ordinary majority.
4.  Pocket veto, that is, taking no action on the bill passed by the
legislature.
Of the above four, the President of India is vested with three–absolute
veto, suspensive veto and pocket veto. There is no qualified veto in the case
of Indian President; it is possessed by the American President. The three
vetos of the President of India are explained below:
Absolute Veto
It refers to the power of the President to withhold his assent to a bill passed
by the Parliament. The bill then ends and does not become an act. Usually,
this veto is exercised in the following two cases:
(a)  With respect to private members’ bills (ie, bills introduced by any
member of Parliament who is not a minister); and
(b)  With respect to the government bills when the cabinet resigns
(after the passage of the bills but before the assent by the President)
and the new cabinet advises the President not to give his assent to such
bills.
In 1954, President Dr. Rajendra Prasad withheld his assent to the PEPSU
Appropriation Bill. The bill was passed by the Parliament when the
President’s Rule was in operation in the state of PEPSU. But, when the bill
was presented to the President for his assent, the President’s Rule was
revoked.
Again in 1991, President R Venkataraman withheld his assent to the
Salary, Allowances and Pension of Members of Parliament (Amendment)
Bill. The bill was passed by the Parliament (on the last day before
dissolution of Lok Sabha) without obtaining the previous recommendation
of the President.
Suspensive Veto
The President exercises this veto when he returns a bill for reconsideration
of the Parliament. However, if the bill is passed again by the Parliament
with or without amendments and again presented to the President, it is
obligatory for the President to give his assent to the bill. This means that the
presidential veto is overridden by a re-passage of the bill by the same
ordinary majority (and not a higher majority as required in USA).
As mentioned earlier, the President does not possess this veto in the case
of money bills. The President can either give his assent to a money bill or
withhold his assent to a money bill but cannot return it for the
reconsideration of the Parliament. Normally, the President gives his assent
to money bill as it is introduced in the Parliament with his previous
permission.
Pocket Veto
In this case, the President neither ratifies nor rejects nor returns the bill, but
simply keeps the bill pending for an indefinite period. This power of the
President not to take any action (either positive or negative) on the bill is
known as the pocket veto. The President can exercise this veto power as the
Constitution does not prescribe any time-limit within which he has to take
the decision with respect to a bill presented to him for his assent. In USA,
on the other hand, the President has to return the bill for reconsideration
within 10 days. Hence, it is remarked that the pocket of the Indian President
is bigger than that of the American President.
In 1986, President Zail Singh exercised the pocket veto with respect to
the Indian Post Office (Amendment) Bill. The bill, passed by the Rajiv
Gandhi Government, imposed restrictions on the freedom of press and
hence, was widely criticised. After three years, in 1989, the next President
R Venkataraman sent the bill back for reconsideration, but the new National
Front Government decided to drop the bill.
It should be noted here that the President has no veto power in respect of
a constitutional amendment bill. The 24th Constitutional Amendment Act
of 1971 made it obligatory for the President to give his assent to a
constitutional amendment bill.
Presidential Veto over State Legislation
The President has veto power with respect to state legislation also. A bill
passed by a state legislature can become an act only if it receives the assent
of the governor or the President (in case the bill is reserved for the
consideration of the President).
When a bill, passed by a state legislature, is presented to the governor for
his assent, he has four alternatives (under Article 200 of the Constitution):
1.  He may give his assent to the bill, or
2.  He may withhold his assent to the bill, or
3.  He may return the bill (if it is not a money bill) for reconsideration
of the state legislature, or
4.  He may reserve the bill for the consideration of the President.

When a bill is reserved by the governor for the consideration of the
President, the President has three alternatives (Under Article 201 of the
Constitution):
1.  He may give his assent to the bill, or
2.  He may withhold his assent to the bill, or
3.  He may direct the governor to return the bill (if it is not a money
bill) for the reconsideration of the state legislature. If the bill is passed
again by the state legislature with or without amendments and
presented again to the President for his assent, the President is not
bound to give his assent to the bill. This means that the state legislature
cannot override the veto power of the President. Further, the
Constitution has not prescribed any time limit within which the
President has to take decision with regard to a bill reserved by the
governor for his consideration. Hence, the President can exercise
pocket veto in respect of state legislation also.
Table 17.2 summarises the discussion on the veto power of the President
with regard to Central as well as state legislation.
ORDINANCE-MAKING POWER OF THE PRESIDENT
Article 123 of the Constitution empowers the President to promulgate
ordinances during the recess of Parliament. These ordinances have the same
force and effect as an act of Parliament, but are in the nature of temporary
laws.
The ordinance-making power is the most important legislative power of
the President. It has been vested in him to deal with unforeseen or urgent
matters. But, the exercises of this power is subject to the following four
limitations:
1. He can promulgate an ordinance only when both the Houses of
Parliament are not in session or when either of the two Houses of
Parliament is not in session. An ordinance can also be issued when only one
House is in session because a law can be passed by both the Houses and not
by one House alone. An ordinance made when both the Houses are in
session is void. Thus, the power of the President to legislate by ordinance is
not a parallel power of legislation.
2. He can make an ordinance only when he is satisfied that the
circumstances exist that render it necessary for him to take immediate
action. In Cooper case11
, (1970), the Supreme Court held that the
President’s satisfaction can be questioned in a court on the ground of
malafide. This means that the decision of the President to issue an
ordinance can be questioned in a court on the ground that the President has
prorogued one House or both Houses of Parliament deliberately with a view
to promulgate an ordinance on a controversial subject, so as to bypass the
parliamentary decision and thereby circumventing the authority of the
Parliament. The 38th Constitutional Amendment Act of 1975 made the
President’s satisfaction final and conclusive and beyond judicial review.
But, this provision was deleted by the 44th Constitutional Amendment Act
of 1978. Thus, the President’s satisfaction is justiciable on the ground of
malafide.
3. His ordinance-making power is coextensive as regards all matters
except duration, with the law-making powers of the Parliament. This has
two implications:
(a)  An ordinance can be issued only on those subjects on which the
Parliament can make laws.
(b)  An ordinance is subject to the same constitutional limitation as an
act of Parliament. Hence, an ordinance cannot abridge or take away
any of the fundamental rights12
 .
4. Every ordinance issued by the President during the recess of
Parliament must be laid before both the Houses of Parliament when it
reassembles. If the ordinance is approved by both the Houses, it becomes an
act. If Parliament takes no action at all, the ordinance ceases to operate on
the expiry of six weeks from the reassembly of Parliament. The ordinance
may also cease to operate even earlier than the prescribed six weeks, if both
the Houses of Parliament pass resolutions disapproving it. If the Houses of
Parliament are summoned to reassemble on different dates, the period of six
weeks is calculated from the later of those dates. This means that the
maximum life of an ordinance can be six months and six weeks, in case of
non-approval by the Parliament (six months being the maximum gap
between the two sessions of Parliament). If an ordinance is allowed to lapse
without being placed before Parliament, then the acts done and completed
under it, before it ceases to operate, remain fully valid and effective.
The President can also withdraw an ordinance at any time. However, his
power of ordinance-making is not a discretionary power, and he can
promulgate or withdraw an ordinance only on the advice of the council of
ministers headed by the prime minister.
An ordinance like any other legislation, can be retrospective, that is, it
may come into force from a back date. It may modify or repeal any act of
Parliament or another ordinance. It can alter or amend a tax law also.
However, it cannot be issued to amend the Constitution.
The ordinance-making power of the President in India is rather unusual
and not found in most of the democratic Constitutions of the world
including that of USA, and UK. In justification of the ordinance-making
power of the President, Dr. B.R. Ambedkar said in the Constituent
Assembly that the mechanism of issuing an ordinance has been devised in
order to enable the Executive to deal with a situation that may suddenly and
immediately arise when the Parliament is not in session13
. It must be
clarified here that the ordinance-making power of the President has no
necessary connection with the national emergency envisaged in Article 352.
The President can issue an ordinance even when there is no war or external
aggression or armed rebellion.
The rules of Lok Sabha require that whenever a bill seeking to replace an
ordinance is introduced in the House, a statement explaining the
circumstances that had necessitated immediate legislation by ordinance
should also be placed before the House.
So far, no case has gone to the Supreme Court regarding promulgation of
ordinance by the President.
But, the judgement of the Supreme Court in the D.C. Wadhwa case14
(1987) is highly relevant here. In that case, the court pointed out that
between 1967–1981 the Governor of Bihar promulgated 256 ordinances and
all these were kept in force for periods ranging from one to fourteen years
by promulgation from time to time. The court ruled that successive
repromulgation of ordinances with the same text without any attempt to get
the bills passed by the assembly would amount to violation of the
Constitution and the ordinance so repromulgated is liable to be struck
down. It held that the exceptional power of law-making through ordinance
cannot be used as a substitute for the legislative power of the state
legislature.
PARDONING POWER OF THE PRESIDENT
Article 72 of the Constitution empowers the President to grant pardons to
persons who have been tried and convicted of any offence in all cases
where the:
1.  Punishment or sentence is for an offence against a Union Law;
2.  Punishment or sentence is by a court martial (military court); and
3.  Sentence is a sentence of death.
The pardoning power of the President is independent of the Judiciary; it
is an executive power. But, the President while exercising this power, does
not sit as a court of appeal. The object of conferring this power on the
President is two-fold: (a) to keep the door open for correcting any judicial
errors in the operation of law; and, (b) to afford relief from a sentence,
which the President regards as unduly harsh.
The pardoning power of the President includes the following:
1. Pardon
It removes both the sentence and the conviction and completely absolves
the convict from all sentences, punishments and disqualifications.
2. Commutation
It denotes the substitution of one form of punishment for a lighter form. For
example, a death sentence may be commuted to rigorous imprisonment,
which in turn may be commuted to a simple imprisonment.
3. Remission
It implies reducing the period of sentence without changing its character.
For example, a sentence of rigorous imprisonment for two years may be
remitted to rigorous imprisonment for one year.
4. Respite
It denotes awarding a lesser sentence in place of one originally awarded due
to some special fact, such as the physical disability of a convict or the
pregnancy of a woman offender.
5. Reprieve
It implies a stay of the execution of a sentence (especially that of death) for
a temporary period. Its purpose is to enable the convict to have time to seek
pardon or commutation from the President.
Under Article 161 of the Constitution, the governor of a state also
possesses the pardoning power. Hence, the governor can also grant pardons,
reprieves, respites and remissions of punishment or suspend, remit and
commute the sentence of any person convicted of any offence against a
state law. But, the pardoning power of the governor differs from that of the
President in following two respects:
1.  The President can pardon sentences inflicted by court martial
(military courts) while the governor cannot.
2.  The President can pardon death sentence while governor cannot.
Even if a state law prescribes death sentence, the power to grant
pardon lies with the President and not the governor. However, the
governor can suspend, remit or commute a death sentence. In other
words, both the governor and the President have concurrent power in
respect of suspension, remission and commutation of death sentence.
The Supreme Court examined the pardoning power of the President
under different cases and laid down the following principles:
1.  The petitioner for mercy has no right to an oral hearing by the
President.
2.  The President can examine the evidence afresh and take a view
different from the view taken by the court.
3.  The power is to be exercised by the President on the advice of the
union cabinet.
4.  The President is not bound to give reasons for his order.
5.  The President can afford relief not only from a sentence that he
regards as unduly harsh but also from an evident mistake.
6.  There is no need for the Supreme Court to lay down specific
guidelines for the exercise of power by the President.
7.  The exercise of power by the President is not subject to judicial
review except where the presidential decision is arbitrary, irrational,
mala fide or discriminatory.
8.  Where the earlier petition for mercy has been rejected by the
President, stay cannot be obtained by filing another petition.
CONSTITUTIONAL POSITION OF THE PRESIDENT
The Constitution of India has provided for a parliamentary form of
government. Consequently, the President has been made only a nominal
executive; the real executive being the council of ministers headed by the
prime minister. In other words, the President has to exercise his powers and
functions with the aid and advise of the council of ministers headed by the
prime minister.
Dr. B.R. Ambedkar summed up the true position of the President in the
following way15
 :
“In the Indian Constitution, there is placed at the head of the Indian
Union a functionary who is called the President of the Union. The title of
the functionary reminds of the President of the United States. But beyond
the identity of names, there is nothing in common between the form of
government prevalent in America and the form of government adopted
under the Indian Constitution. The American form of government is called
the presidential system of government and what the Indian Constitution
adopted is the Parliamentary system. Under the presidential system of
America, the President is the Chief head of the Executive and
administration is vested in him. Under the Indian Constitution, the President
occupies the same position as the King under the English Constitution. He
is the head of the State but not of the Executive. He represents the nation
but does not rule the nation. He is the symbol of the nation. His place in
administration is that of a ceremonial device or a seal by which the nation’s
decisions are made known. He is generally bound by the advice of his
ministers. He can do nothing contrary to their advice nor can he do anything
without their advice. The President of the United States can dismiss any
secretary at any time. The President of the Indian Union has no power to do
so, so long as his ministers command a majority in Parliament”.
In estimating the constitutional position of the President, particular
reference has to be made to the provisions of Articles 53, 74 and 75. These
are:
1.  The executive power of the Union shall be vested in President and
shall be exercised by him either directly or through officers
subordinate to him in accordance with this Constitution (Article 53).
2.  There shall be a council of ministers with the Prime Minister at the
head to aid and advise the President who ‘shall’, in the exercise of his
functions, act in accordance with such advice (Article 74).
3.  The council of ministers shall be collectively responsible to the Lok
Sabha (Article 75). This provision is the foundation of the
parliamentary system of government.
The 42nd Constitutional Amendment Act of 1976 (enacted by the Indira
Gandhi Government) made the President bound by the advice of the council
of ministers headed by the prime minister16
. The 44th Constitutional
Amendment Act of 1978 (enacted by the Janata Party Government headed
by Morarji Desai) authorised the President to require the council of
ministers to reconsider such advice either generally or otherwise. However,
he ‘shall’ act in accordance with the advice tendered after such
reconsideration. In other words, the President may return a matter once for
reconsideration of his ministers, but the reconsidered advice shall be
binding.
In October 1997, the cabinet recommended President K.R. Narayanan to
impose President’s Rule (under Article 356) in Uttar Pradesh. The President
returned the matter for the reconsideration of the cabinet, which then
decided not to move ahead in the matter. Hence, the BJP-led government
under Kalyan Singh was saved. Again in September 1998, the President KR
Narayanan returned a recommendation of the cabinet that sought the
imposition of the President’s Rule in Bihar. After a couple of months, the
cabinet re-advised the same. It was only then that the President’s Rule was
imposed in Bihar, in February 1999.
Though the President has no constitutional discretion, he has some
situational discretion. In other words, the President can act on his discretion
(that is, without the advice of the ministers) under the following situations:
(i) Appointment of Prime Minister when no party has a clear
majority in the Lok Sabha or when the Prime Minister in office
dies suddenly and there is no obvious successor.
(ii) Dismissal of the council of ministers when it cannot prove the
confidence of the Lok Sabha.
(iii) Dissolution of the Lok Sabha if the council of ministers has lost
its majority.

18 Vice-President
The Vice-President occupies the second highest office in the country. He is
accorded a rank next to the President in the official warrant of precedence.
This office is modelled on the lines of the American Vice-President.
ELECTION
The Vice-President, like the president, is elected not directly by the people
but by the method of indirect election. He is elected by the members of an
electoral college consisting of the members of both Houses of Parliament.1
Thus, this electoral college is different from the electoral college for the
election of the President in the following two respects:
1.  It consists of both elected and nominated members of the
Parliament (in the case of president, only elected members).
2.  It does not include the members of the state legislative assemblies
(in the case of President, the elected members of the state legislative
assemblies are included). Explaining the reason for this difference, Dr.
B.R. Ambedkar observed:2
“The President is the head of the State and his power extends both to the
administration by the Centre as well as to the states. Consequently, it is
necessary that in his election, not only members of Parliament should play
their part, but the members of the state legislatures should have a voice.
But, when we come to the Vice-President, his normal functions are to
preside over the council of states. It is only on a rare occasion, and that too
for a temporary period, that he may be called upon to assume the duties of
the president. That being so, it does not seem necessary that the members of
the state legislatures should also be invited to take part in the election of the
Vice-President”.
But, the manner of election is same in both the cases. Thus, the VicePresident’s election, like that of the President’s election, is held in
accordance with the system of proportional representation by means of the
single transferable vote and the voting is by secret ballot.3
All doubts and disputes in connection with election of the Vice-President
are inquired into and decided by the Supreme Court whose decision is final.
The election of a person as Vice-President cannot be challenged on the
ground that the electoral college was incomplete (i.e., existence of any
vacancy among the members of electoral college). If the election of a
person as VicePresident is declared void by the Supreme Court, acts done
by him before the date of such declaration of the Supreme Court are not
invalidated (i.e., they continue to remain in force).
QUALIFICATIONS, OATH AND CONDITIONS
Qualifications
To be eligible for election as Vice-President, a person should fulfil the
following qualifications:
1.  He should be a citizen of India.
2.  He should have completed 35 years of age.
3.  He should be qualified for election as a member of the Rajya
Sabha.
4.  He should not hold any office of profit under the Union government
or any state government or any local authority or any other public
authority.

But, a sitting President or Vice-President of the Union, the governor of
any state and a minister for the Union or any state is not deemed to hold any
office of profit and hence qualified for being a candidate for Vice-President.
Further, the nomination of a candidate for election to the office of VicePresident must be subscribed by at least 20 electors as proposers and 20
electors as seconders. Every candidate has to make a security deposit of
₹15,000 in the Reserve Bank of India.4
Oath or Affirmation
Before entering upon his office, the VicePresident has to make and
subscribe to an oath or affirmation. In his oath, the VicePresident swears:
1.  to bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of India; and
2.  to faithfully discharge the duties of his office.
The oath of office to the Vice-President is administered by the President
or some person appointed in that behalf by him.
Conditions of Office
The Constitution lays down the following two conditions of the VicePresident’s office:
1.  He should not be a member of either House of Parliament or a
House of the state legislature. If any such person is elected VicePresident, he is deemed to have vacated his seat in that House on the
date on which he enters upon his office as Vice-President.
2.  He should not hold any other office of profit.
TERM AND VACANCY
Term of Office
The Vice-President holds office for a term of five years from the date on
which he enters upon his office. However, he can resign from his office at
any time by addressing the resignation letter to the President. He can also
be removed from the office before completion of his term. A formal
impeachment is not required for his removal. He can be removed by a
resolution passed by a majority of all the then members of the Rajya Sabha
and agreed to by the Lok Sabha. This means that this resolution should be
passed in the Rajya Sabha by an effective majority and in the Lok Sabha by
a simple majority. It must be noted here that the effective majority in India
is only a type of special majority and not a separate one. Further, this
resolution can be introduced only in the Rajya Sabha and not in the Lok
Sabha. But, no such resolution can be moved unless at least 14 days’
advance notice has been given. Notably, no ground has been mentioned in
the Constitution for his removal.
The Vice-President can hold office beyond his term of five years until his
successor assumes charge. He is also eligible for reelection to that office.
He may be elected for any number of terms.5
Vacancy in Office
A vacancy in the Vice-President’s office can occur in any of the following
ways:
1.  On the expiry of his tenure of five years.
2.  By his resignation.
3.  On his removal.
4.  By his death.6
5.  Otherwise, for example, when he becomes disqualified to hold
office or when his election is declared void.
When the vacancy is going to be caused by the expiration of the term of
the sitting vicepresident, an election to fill the vacancy must be held before
the expiration of the term.
If the office falls vacant by resignation, removal, death or otherwise, then
election to fill the vacancy should be held as soon as possible after the
occurrence of the vacancy. The newly-elected vice-president remains in
office for a full term of five years from the date he assumes charge of his
office.
POWERS AND FUNCTIONS
The functions of Vice-President are two-fold:
1.  He acts as the ex-officio Chairman of Rajya Sabha. In this capacity,
his powers and functions are similar to those of the Speaker of Lok
Sabha. In this respect, he resembles the American vicepresident who
also acts as the Chairman of the Senate–the Upper House of the
American legislature.
2.  He acts as President when a vacancy occurs in the office of the
President due to his resignation, impeachment, death or otherwise.7 He
can act as President only for a maximum period of six months within
which a new President has to be elected. Further, when the sitting
President is unable to discharge his functions due to absence, illness or
any other cause, the Vice-President discharges his functions until the
President resumes his office.8
While acting as President or discharging the functions of President, the
Vice-President does not perform the duties of the office of the chairman of
Rajya Sabha. During this period, those duties are performed by the Deputy
Chairman of Rajya Sabha.
The Constitution has not fixed any emoluments for the Vice-President in
that capacity. He draws his regular salary in his capacity as the ex-officio
Chairman of the Rajya Sabha. In 2018, the Parliament increased the salary
of the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha from ₹1.25 lakh to ₹4 lakh per month9
.
Earlier in 2008, the pension of the retired Vice-President was increased
from ₹20,000 per month to 50% of his salary per month10
. In addition, he is
entitled to daily allowance, free furnished residence, medical, travel and
other facilities.
During any period when the Vice-President acts as President or
discharges the functions of the President, he is not entitled to the salary or
allowance payable to the Chairman of Rajya Sabha, but the salary and
allowance of the President.
INDIAN AND AMERICAN VICEPRESIDENTS
COMPARED
Though the office of the Indian VicePresident is modelled on the lines of
the American Vice-President, there is a difference. The American VicePresident succeeds to the presidency when it falls vacant, and remains
President for the unexpired term of his predecessor. The Indian VicePresident, on the other hand, does not assume the office of the President
when it falls vacant for the unexpired term. He merely serves as an acting
President until the new President assumes charge.
From the above it is clear that the Constitution has not assigned any
significant function to the Vice-President in that capacity. Hence, some
scholars call him ‘His Superfluous Highness’. This office was created with
a view to maintain the political continuity of the Indian State.

19 Prime Minister
In the scheme of parliamentary system of government provided by the
constitution, the President is the nominal executive authority (de jure
executive) and Prime Minister is the real executive authority (de facto
executive). In other words, president is the head of the State while Prime
Minister is the head of the government.
APPOINTMENT OF THE PRIME MINISTER
The Constitution does not contain any specific procedure for the selection
and appointment of the Prime Minister. Article 75 says only that the Prime
Minister shall be appointed by the president. However, this does not imply
that the president is free to appoint any one as the Prime Minister. In
accordance with the conventions of the parliamentary system of
government, the President has to appoint the leader of the majority party in
the Lok Sabha as the Prime Minister. But, when no party has a clear
majority in the Lok Sabha, then the President may exercise his personal
discretion in the selection and appointment of the Prime Minister. In such a
situation, the President usually appoints the leader of the largest party or
coalition in the Lok Sabha as the Prime Minister and asks him to seek a
vote of confidence in the House within a month. This discretion was
exercised by the President, for the first time in 1979, when Neelam Sanjiva
Reddy (the then President) appointed Charan Singh (the coalition leader) as
the Prime Minister after the fall of the Janata Party government headed by
Morarji Desai.
There is also one more situation when the president may have to exercise
his individual judgement in the selection and appointment of the Prime
Minister, that is, when the Prime Minister in office dies suddenly and there
is no obvious successor. This is what happened when Indira Gandhi was
assassinated in 1984. The then President Zail Singh appointed Rajiv Gandhi
as the Prime Minister by ignoring the precedent of appointing a caretaker
Prime Minister.
1 Later on, the Congress parliamentary party unanimously
elected him as its leader. However, if, on the death of an incumbent Prime
Minister, the ruling party elects a new leader, the President has no choice
but to appoint him as Prime Minister.
In 1980, the Delhi High Court held that the Constitution does not require
that a person must prove his majority in the Lok Sabha before he is
appointed as the Prime Minister. The President may first appoint him the
Prime Minister and then ask him to prove his majority in the Lok Sabha
within a reasonable period. For example, Charan Singh (1979), V.P. Singh
(1989), Chandrasekhar (1990), P.V. Narasimha Rao (1991), A.B. Vajyapee
(1996), Deve Gowda (1996), I.K. Gujral (1997) and again A.B. Vajpayee
(1998) were appointed as Prime Ministers in this way.
In 1997, the Supreme Court held that a person who is not a member of
either House of Parliament can be appointed as Prime Minister for six
months, within which, he should become a member of either House of
Parliament; otherwise, he ceases to be the Prime Minister.
Constitutionally, the Prime Minister may be a member of any of the two
Houses of parliament. For example, three Prime Ministers, Indira Gandhi
(1966), Deve Gowda (1996) and Manmohan Singh (2004), were members
of the Rajya Sabha. In Britain, on the other hand, the Prime Minister should
definitely be a member of the Lower House (House of Commons).
OATH, TERM AND SALARY
Before the Prime Minister enters upon his office, the president administers
to him the oaths of office and secrecy.
2
In his oath of office, the Prime
Minister swears:
1.  to bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of India,
2.  to uphold the sovereignty and integrity of India,
3.  to faithfully and conscientiously discharge the duties of his office,
and
4.  to do right to all manner of people in accordance with the
Constitution and the law, without fear or favour, affection or ill will.
In his oath of secrecy, the Prime Minister swears that he will not directly
or indirectly communicate or reveal to any person(s) any matter that is
brought under his consideration or becomes known to him as a Union
Minister except as may be required for the due discharge of his duties as
such minister.
The term of the Prime Minister is not fixed and he holds office during the
pleasure of the president. However, this does not mean that the president
can dismiss the Prime Minister at any time. So long as the Prime Minister
enjoys the majority support in the Lok Sabha, he cannot be dismissed by the
President. However, if he loses the confidence of the Lok Sabha, he must
resign or the President can dismiss him.3
The salary and allowances of the Prime Minister are determined by the
Parliament from time to time. He gets the salary and allowances that are
payable to a member of Parliament. Additionally, he gets a sumptuary
allowance, free accommodation, travelling allowance, medical facilities,
etc. In 2001, the Parliament increased his sumptuary allowance from
₹1,500 to ₹3,000 per month.
POWERS AND FUNCTIONS OF THE PRIME
MINISTER
The powers and functions of Prime Minister can be studied under the
following heads:
In Relation to Council of Ministers
The Prime Minister enjoys the following powers as head of the Union
council of ministers:
1.  He recommends persons who can be appointed as ministers by the
president. The President can appoint only those persons as ministers
who are recommended by the Prime Minister.
2.  He allocates and reshuffles various portfolios among the ministers.
3.  He can ask a minister to resign or advise the President to dismiss
him in case of difference of opinion.
4.  He presides over the meeting of council of ministers and influences
its decisions.
5.  He guides, directs, controls, and coordinates the activities of all the
ministers.
6.  He can bring about the collapse of the council of ministers by
resigning from office.
Since the Prime Minister stands at the head of the council of ministers,
the other ministers cannot function when the Prime Minister resigns or dies.
In other words, the resignation or death of an incumbent Prime Minister
automatically dissolves the council of ministers and thereby generates a
vacuum. The resignation or death of any other minister, on the other hand,
merely creates a vacancy which the Prime Minister may or may not like to
fill.
In Relation to the President
The Prime Minister enjoys the following powers in relation to the President:
1.  He is the principal channel of communication between the
President and the council of ministers.4
It is the duty of the prime
minister:
(a)  to communicate to the President all decisions of the council of
ministers relating to the administration of the affairs of the Union and
proposals for legislation;
(b)  to furnish such information relating to the administration of the
affairs of the Union and proposals for legislation as the President may
call for; and
(c)  if the President so requires, to submit for the consideration of the
council of ministers any matter on which a decision has been taken by
a minister but which has not been considered by the council.
2.  He advises the president with regard to the appointment of
important officials like attorney general of India, Comptroller and
Auditor General of India, chairman and members of the UPSC,
election commissioners, chairman and members of the finance
commission and so on.
In Relation to Parliament
The Prime Minister is the leader of the Lower House. In this capacity, he
enjoys the following powers:
1.  He advises the President with regard to summoning and proroguing
of the sessions of the Parliament.
2.  He can recommend dissolution of the Lok Sabha to President at any
time.
3.  He announces government policies on the floor of the House.
Other Powers & Functions
In addition to the above-mentioned three major roles, the Prime Minister
has various other roles. These are:
1.  He is the chairman of the NITI Ayog (which succeded the planning
commission), National Integration Council, InterState Council,
National Water Resources Council and some other bodies.
2.  He plays a significant role in shaping the foreign policy of the
country.
3.  He is the chief spokesman of the Union government.
4.  He is the crisis manager-in-chief at the political level during
emergencies.
5.  As a leader of the nation, he meets various sections of people in
different states and receives memoranda from them regarding their
problems, and so on.
6.  He is leader of the party in power.
7.  He is political head of the services.
Thus, the Prime Minister plays a very significant and highly crucial role
in the politico-administrative system of the country. Dr. B.R. Ambedkar
stated, ‘If any functionary under our constitution is to be compared with the
US president, he is the Prime Minister and not the president of the Union’.
ROLE DESCRIPTIONS
The various comments made by the eminent political scientists and
constitutional experts on the role of Prime Minister in Britain holds good in
the Indian context also. These are mentioned below:
Lord Morely
He described Prime Minister as ‘primus inter pares’ (first among equals)
and ‘key stone of the cabinet arch’. He said, “The head of the cabinet is
‘primus inter pares’, and occupied a position which so long as it lasts, is one
of exceptional and peculiar authority”.
Herbert Marrison
“As the head of the Government, he (prime minister) is ‘primus inter pares’.
But, it is today for too modest an appreciation of the Prime Minister’s
position”.
Sir William Vernor Harcourt
He described Prime Minister as ‘inter stellas luna minores’ (a moon among
lesser stars).
Jennings
“He is, rather, a sun around which planets revolve. He is the key-stone of
the constitution. All roads in the constitution lead to the Prime Minister.”
H.J. Laski
On the relationship between the Prime Minister and the cabinet, he said that
the Prime Minister “is central to its formation, central to its life, and central
to its death”. He described him as “the pivot around which the entire
governmental machinery revolves.”
H.R.G. Greaves
“The Government is the master of the country and he (Prime Minister) is
the master of the Government.”
Munro
He called Prime Minister as “the captain of the ship of the state”.
Ramsay Muir
He described Prime Minister as “the steersman of steering wheel of the ship
of the state.”
The role of the Prime Minister in the British parliamentary government is
so significant and crucial that observers like to call it a ‘Prime Ministerial
government.’ Thus, R.H. Crossman says, ‘The post-war epoch has been the
final transformation of cabinet government into Prime Ministerial
government.’ Similarly, Humphrey Berkely points out, ‘Parliament is not,
in practice, sovereign. The parliamentary democracy has now collapsed at
Westminster. The basic defect in the British system of governing is the
super-ministerial powers of the Prime Minister.’ The same description holds
good to the Indian context too.
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PRESIDENT
The following provisions of the Constitution deal with the relationship
between the President and the Prime Minister:
1. Article 74
There shall be a council of ministers with the Prime Minister at the head to
aid and advise the President who shall, in the exercise of his functions, act
in accordance with such advice. However, the President may require the
council of ministers to reconsider such advice and the President shall act in
accordance with the advice tendered after such reconsideration.
2. Article 75
(a) The Prime Minister shall be appointed by the President and the other
ministers shall be appointed by the president on the advice of the Prime
Minister; (b) The ministers shall hold office during the pleasure of the
president; and (c) The council of ministers shall be collectively responsible
to the House of the People.
3. Article 78
It shall be the duty of the Prime Minister:
(a)  to communicate to the President all decisions of the council of
ministers relating to the administration of the affairs of the Union and
proposals for legislation;
(b)  to furnish such information relating to the administration of the
affairs of the Union and proposals for legislation as the President may
call for; and
(c)  if the President so requires, to submit for the consideration of the
council of ministers any matter on which a decision has been taken by
a minister but which has not been considered by the council.
CHIEF MINISTERS WHO BECAME PRIME
MINISTERS
Six people–Morarji Desai, Charan Singh, V.P. Singh, P.V. Narasimha Rao,
H.D. Deve Gowda and Narendra Modi–became Prime Ministers after being
Chief Ministers of their respective States. Morarji Desai, Chief Minister of
the erstwhile Bombay State during 1952–56, became the first non-Congress
Prime Minister in March 1977. Charan Singh, who succeeded him, was the
Chief Minister of the undivided Uttar Pradesh in 1967–1968 and again in
1970. V.P. Singh, also from U.P., became Prime Minister in the short lived
National Front government (December 1989-November 1990). P.V.
Narasimha Rao, the first Prime Minister from South India, who held the
post from 1991–1996, was Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh between
1971–1973. H.D. Deve Gowda was Chief Minister of Karnataka when he
was chosen to lead the United Front government in June 19965
 .
Narendra Modi (BJP) was the Chief Minister of Gujarat when he became
the Prime Minister in May 2014. He served as the Chief Minister of Gujarat
for four times during 2001 to 2014.

20 Central Council of Ministers
As the Constitution of India provides for a parliamentary system of
government modelled on the British pattern, the council of ministers headed
by the prime minister is the real executive authority is our politicoadministrative system.
The principles of parliamentary system of government are not detailed in
the Constitution, but two Articles (74 and 75) deal with them in a broad,
sketchy and general manner. Article 74 deals with the status of the council
of ministers while Article 75 deals with the appointment, tenure,
responsibility, qualification, oath and salaries and allowances of the
ministers.
CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS
Article 74—Council of Ministers to aid and advise President
1.  There shall be a Council of Ministers with the Prime Minister at the
head to aid and advise the President who shall, in the exercise of his
functions, act in accordance with such advice. However, the President
may require the Council of Ministers to reconsider such advice and the
President shall act in accordance with the advice tendered after such
reconsideration.
2.  The advice tendered by Ministers to the President shall not be
inquired into in any court.
Article 75–Other Provisions as to Ministers

other Ministers shall be appointed by the President on the advice of the
Prime Minister.
2.  The total number of ministers, including the Prime Minister, in the
Council of Ministers shall not exceed 15% of the total strength of the
Lok Sabha. This provision was added by the 91st Amendment Act of
2003.
3.  A member of either house of Parliament belonging to any political
party who is disqualified on the ground of defection shall also be
disqualified to be appointed as a minister. This provision was also
added by the 91st
 Amendment Act of 2003.
4.  The ministers shall hold office during the pleasure of the President.
5.  The council of ministers shall be collectively responsible to the Lok
Sabha.

the ground that it is not an order or instrument made or executed by the
President.
3.  The President shall make rules for the more convenient transaction
of the business of the Government of India, and for the allocation

Ministers relating to the administration of the affairs of the Union and
proposals for legislation
2.  To furnish such information relating to the administration of the
affairs of the Union and proposals for legislation as the President may
call for
3.  If the President so requires, to submit for the consideration of the
Council of Ministers any matter on which a decision has been taken by
a Minister but which has not been considered by the Council
Article 88–Rights of Ministers as Respects the Houses
Every minister shall have the right to speak and take part in the proceedings
of either House, any joint sitting of the Houses and any Committee of
Parliament of which he may be named a member. But he shall not be
entitled to vote.
NATURE OF ADVICE BY MINISTERS
Article 74 provides for a council of ministers with the Prime Minister at the
head to aid and advise the President in the exercise of his functions. The
42nd and 44th Constitutional Amendment Acts have made the advice
binding on the President.1 Further, the nature of advice tendered by
ministers to the President cannot be enquired by any court. This provision
emphasises the intimate and the confidential relationship between the
President and the ministers.
In 1971, the Supreme Court held that ‘even after the dissolution of the
Lok Sabha, the council of ministers does not cease to hold office. Article 74
is mandatory and, therefore, the president cannot exercise the executive
power without the aid and advise of the council of ministers. Any exercise
of executive power without the aid and advice will be unconstitutional as
being violative of Article 74’. Again in 1974, the court held that ‘wherever
the Constitution requires the satisfaction of the President, the satisfaction is
not the personal satisfaction of the President but it is the satisfaction of the
council of ministers with whose aid and on whose advice the President
exercises his powers and functions’.
APPOINTMENT OF MINISTERS
The Prime Minister is appointed by the President, while the other ministers
are appointed by the President on the advice of the Prime Minister. This
means that the President can appoint only those persons as ministers who
are recommended by the Prime minister.
Usually, the members of Parliament, either Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha,
are appointed as ministers. A person who is not a member of either House
of Parliament can also be appointed as a minister. But, within six months,
he must become a member (either by election or by nomination) of either
House of Parliament, otherwise, he ceases to be a minister.
A minister who is a member of one House of Parliament has the right to
speak and to take part in the proceedings of the other House also, but he can
vote only in the House of which he is a member.
OATH AND SALARY OF MINISTERS
Before a minister enters upon his office, the president administers to him
the oaths of office and secrecy. In his oath of office, the minister swears:
1.  to bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of India,
2.  to uphold the sovereignty and integrity of India,
3.  to faithfully and conscientiously discharge the duties of his office,
and
4.  to do right to all manner of people in accordance with the
Constitution and the law, without fear or favour, affection or ill will.
In his oath of secrecy, the minister swears that he will not directly or
indirectly communicate or reveal to any person(s) any matter that is brought
under his consideration or becomes known to him as a Union minister
except as may be required for the due discharge of his duties as such
minister.
In 1990, the oath by Devi Lal as deputy prime minister was challenged as
being unconstitutional as the Constitution provides only for the Prime
Minister and ministers. The Supreme Court upheld the oath as valid and
stated that describing a person as Deputy Prime Minister is descriptive only
and such description does not confer on him any powers of Prime Minister.
It ruled that the description of a minister as Deputy Prime Minister or any
other type of minister such as minister of state or deputy minister of which
there is no mention in the Constitution does not vitiate the oath taken by
him so long as the substantive part of the oath is correct.
The salaries and allowances of ministers are determined by Parliament
from time to time.2 A minister gets the salary and allowances that are
payable to a member of Parliament. Additionally, he gets a sumptuary
allowance (according to his rank), free accommodation, travelling
allowance, medical facilities, etc. In 2001, the sumptuary allowance for the
prime minister was raised from ₹1,500 to ₹3,000 per month, for a cabinet
minister from ₹1,000 to ₹2,000 per month, for a minister of state from
₹500 to ₹1,000 per month and for a deputy minister from ₹300 to ₹600 per
month.
RESPONSIBILITY OF MINISTERS
Collective Responsibility
The fundamental principle underlying the working of parliamentary system
of government is the principle of collective responsibility. Article 75 clearly
states that the council of ministers is collectively responsible to the Lok
Sabha. This means that all the ministers own joint responsibility to the Lok
Sabha for all their acts of ommission and commission. They work as a team
and swim or sink together. When the Lok Sabha passes a no-confidence
motion against the council of ministers, all the ministers have to resign
including those ministers who are from the Rajya Sabha.3 Alternatively, the
council of ministers can advise the president to dissolve the Lok Sabha on
the ground that the House does not represent the views of the electorate
faithfully and call for fresh elections. The President may not oblige the
council of ministers that has lost the confidence of the Lok Sabha.
The principle of collective responsibility also means that the Cabinet
decisions bind all cabinet ministers (and other ministers) even if they
differed in the cabinet meeting. It is the duty of every minister to stand by
cabinet decisions and support them both within and outside the Parliament.
If any minister disagrees with a cabinet decision and is not prepared to
defend it, he must resign. Several ministers have resigned in the past owing
to their differences with the cabinet. For example, Dr. B.R. Ambedkar
resigned because of his differences with his colleagues on the Hindu Code
Bill in 1953. C.D. Deshmukh resigned due to his differences on the policy
of reorganisation of states. Arif Mohammed resigned due to his opposition
to the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986.
Individual Responsibility
Article 75 also contains the principle of individual responsibility. It states
that the ministers hold office during the pleasure of the president, which
means that the President can remove a minister even at a time when the
council of ministers enjoys the confidence of the Lok Sabha. However, the
President removes a minister only on the advice of the Prime Minister. In
case of a difference of opinion or dissatisfaction with the performance of a
minister, the Prime Minister can ask him to resign or advice the President to
dismiss him. By exercising this power, the Prime Minister can ensure the
realisation of the rule of collective responsibility. In this context, Dr. B.R.
Ambedkar observed:
“Collective responsibility can be achieved only through the
instrumentality of the Prime Minister. Therefore, unless and until we
create that office and endow that office with statutory authority to
nominate and dismiss ministers, there can be no collective
responsibility.”4
No Legal Responsibility
In Britain, every order of the King for any public act is countersigned by a
minister. If the order is in violation of any law, the minister would be held
responsible and would be liable in the court. The legally accepted phrase in
Britain is, “The king can do no wrong.” Hence, he cannot be sued in any
court.
In India, on the other hand, there is no provision in the Constitution for
the system of legal responsibility of a minister. It is not required that an
order of the President for a public act should be countersigned by a
minister. Moreover, the courts are barred from enquiring into the nature of
advice rendered by the ministers to the president.
COMPOSITION OF THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS
The council of ministers consists of three categories of ministers, namely,
cabinet ministers, ministers of state,5 and deputy ministers. The difference
between them lies in their respective ranks, emoluments, and political
importance. At the top of all these ministers stands the Prime Minister–the
supreme governing authority of the country.
The cabinet ministers head the important ministries of the Central
government like home, defence, finance, external affairs and so forth. They
are members of the cabinet, attend its meetings and play an important role
in deciding policies. Thus, their responsibilities extend over the entire
gamut of Central government.
The ministers of state can either be given independent charge of
ministries/ departments or can be attached to cabinet ministers. In case of
attachment, they may either be given the charge of departments of the
ministries headed by the cabinet ministers or allotted specific items of work
related to the ministries headed by cabinet ministers. In both the cases, they
work under the supervision and guidance as well as under the overall charge
and responsibility of the cabinet ministers. In case of independent charge,
they perform the same functions and exercise the same powers in relation to
their ministries/departments as cabinet ministers do. However, they are not
members of the cabinet and do not attend the cabinet meetings unless
specially invited when something related to their ministries/ departments
are considered by the cabinet.
Next in rank are the deputy ministers. They are not given independent
charge of ministries/departments. They are attached to the cabinet ministers
or ministers of state and assist them in their administrative, political, and
parliamentary duties. They are not members of the cabinet and do not attend
cabinet meetings.
It must also be mentioned here that there is one more category of
ministers, called parliamentary secretaries. They are the members of the last
category of the council of ministers (which is also known as the ‘ministry’).
They have no department under their control. They are attached to the
senior ministers and assist them in the discharge of their parliamentary
duties. However, since 1967, no parliamentary secretaries have been
appointed except during the first phase of Rajiv Gandhi Government.
At times, the council of ministers may also include a deputy prime
minister. The deputy prime ministers are appointed mostly for political
reasons.
COUNCIL OF MINISTERS VS CABINET
The words ‘council of ministers’ and ‘cabinet’ are often used
interchangeably though there is a definite distinction between them. They
differ from each other in respects of composition, functions, and role. These
differences are shown in Table 20.1.
ROLE OF CABINET
1.  It is the highest decision-making authority in our politicoadministrative system.
2.  It is the chief policy formulating body of the Central government.
3.  It is the supreme executive authority of the Central government.
4.  It is chief coordinator of Central administration.
5.  It is an advisory body to the president and its advice is binding on
him.
6.  It is the chief crisis manager and thus deals with all emergency
situations.
7.  It deals with all major legislative and financial matters.
8.  It exercises control over higher appointments like constitutional
authorities and senior secretariat administrators.
9.  It deals with all foreign policies and foreign affairs.
Table 20.1  Distinction Between Council of Ministers and Cabinet
Council of ministers Cabinet
1.  It is a wider body consisting of
60 to 70 ministers.
1.  It is a smaller body
consisting of 15 to 20
ministers.
2.  It includes all the three
categories of ministers, that is,
cabinet ministers, ministers of
state, and deputy ministers.
2.  It includes the cabinet
ministers only. Thus, it is a
part of the council of
ministers.
3.  It does not meet, as a body, to
transact government business. It
has no collective functions.
3.  It meets, as a body,
frequently and usually once
in a week to deliberate and
take decisions regarding the
transaction of government
business. Thus, it has
collective functions.
4.  It is vested with all powers but
in theory.
4.  It exercises, in practice,
the powers of the council of
ministers and thus, acts for
the latter.
5.  Its functions are determined by
the cabinet.
5.  It directs the council of
ministers by taking policy
decisions which are binding
on all ministers.
6.  It implements the decisions
taken by the cabinet.
6.  It supervises the
implementation of its
decisions by the council of
ministers.
7.  It is a constitutional body,
dealt in detail by the Articles 74
and 75 of the Constitution. Its size
and classification are, however,
not mentioned in the Constitution.
Its size is determined by the prime
minister according to the
exigencies of the time and
requirements of the situation. Its
classification into a three-tier body
is based on the conventions of
parliamentary government as
developed in Britain. It has,
however, got a legislative
sanction. Thus, the Salaries and
Allowances Act of 1952 defines a
‘minister’ as a ‘member of the
council of ministers, by whatever
7.  It was inserted in Article
352 of the Constitution in
1978 by the 44th
Constitutional Amendment
Act. Thus, it did not find a
place in the original text of
the Constitution. Now also,
Article 352 only defines the
cabinet saying that it is ‘the
council consisting of the
prime minister and other
ministers of cabinet rank
appointed under Article 75’
and does not describe its
powers and functions. In
other words, its role in our
politico-administrative
system is based on the
name called, and includes a deputy
minister’.

government as developed in
Britain.
8.  It is collectively responsible to
the Lower House of the
Parliament.
8.  It enforces the collective
responsibility of the council
of ministers to the Lower
House of Parliament.
ROLE DESCRIPTIONS
The various comments made by the eminent political scientists and
constitutional experts on the role of cabinet in Britain holds good in the
Indian context also. These are mentioned below.
Ramsay Muir
“The Cabinet is the steering wheel of the ship of the state.”
Lowell
“The Cabinet is the keystone of the political arch”.
Sir John Marriott
“The Cabinet is the pivot around which the whole political machinery
revolves”.
Gladstone
“The Cabinet is the solar orb around which the other bodies revolve”.
Barker
“The Cabinet is the magnet of policy”.
Bagehot
“The Cabinet is a hyphen that joins, the buckle that binds the executive and
legislative departments together”.
Sir Ivor Jennings
“The Cabinet is the core of the British Constitutional System. It provides
unity to the British system of Government”.
L.S. Amery
“The Cabinet is the central directing instrument of Government”.
The position of the Cabinet in the British Government has become so
strong that Ramsay Muir referred to it as the ‘Dictatorship of the Cabinet’.
In his book ‘How Britain is Governed’, he writes “A body which wields
such powers as these may fairly be described as ‘omnipotent’ in theory,
however, incapable it may be of using its omnipotence. Its position,
whenever it commands a majority, is a dictatorship only qualified by
publicity. This dictatorship is far more absolute that it was two generations
ago”. The same description holds good in the Indian context too.
KITCHEN CABINET
The cabinet, a small body consisting of the prime minister as its head and
some 15 to 20 most important ministers, is the highest decision-making
body in the formal sense. However, a still smaller body called the ‘Inner
Cabinet’ or ‘Kitchen Cabinet’ has become the real centre of power. This
informal body consists of the Prime Minister and two to four influential
colleagues in whom he has faith and with whom he can discuss every
problem. It advises the prime minister on important political and
administrative issues and assists him in making crucial decisions. It is
composed of not only cabinet ministers but also outsiders like friends and
family members of the prime minister.
Every prime minister in India has had his ‘Inner Cabinet’–a circle within
a circle. During the era of Indira Gandhi, the ‘Inner Cabinet’ which came to
be called the ‘Kitchen Cabinet’ was particularly powerful.
The prime ministers have resorted to the device of ‘inner cabinet’ (extraconstitutional body) due to its merits, namely:
1.  It being a small unit, is much more efficient decision-making body
than a large cabinet.
2.  It can meet more often and deal with business much more
expeditiously than the large cabinet.
3.  It helps the Prime Minister in maintaining secrecy in making
decisions on important political issues.
However, it has many demerits also. Thus,6
1.  It reduces the authority and status of the cabinet as the highest
decision-making body.
2.  It circumvents the legal process by allowing outside persons to play
an influential role in the government functioning.
The phenomenon of ‘kitchen cabinet’ (where decisions are cooked and
placed before the cabinet for formal approval) is not unique to India. It also
exists in USA and Britain and is quite powerful in influencing government
decisions there.

21 Cabinet Committees
FEATURES OF CABINET COMMITTEES
The following are the features of Cabinet Committees:
1.  They are extra-constitutional in emergence. In other words, they are
not mentioned in the Constitution. However, the Rules of Business
provide for their establishment.
2.  They are of two types–standing and ad hoc. The former are of a
permanent nature while the latter are of a temporary nature. The ad
hoc committees are constituted from time to time to deal with special
problems. They are disbanded after their task is completed.1
3.  They are set up by the Prime Minister according to the exigencies
of the time and requirements of the situation. Hence, their number,
nomenclature, and composition varies from time to time.
4.  Their membership varies from three to eight. They usually include
only Cabinet Ministers. However, the non-cabinet Ministers are not
debarred from their membership.
5.  They not only include the Ministers in charge of subjects covered
by them but also include other senior Ministers.
6.  They are mostly headed by the Prime Minister. Some times other
Cabinet Ministers, particularly the Home Minister or the Finance
Minister, also acts as their Chairman. But, in case the Prime Minister is
a member of a committee, he invariably presides over it.
7.  They not only sort out issues and formulate proposals for the
consideration of the Cabinet, but also take decisions. However, the
Cabinet can review their decisions.
8.  They are an organisational device to reduce the enormous workload
of the Cabinet. They also facilitate in-depth examination of policy
issues and effective coordination. They are based on the principles of
division of labour and effective delegation.
LIST OF CABINET COMMITTEES
In 1994, there were the following 13 Cabinet Committees:
1.  Cabinet Committee on Political Affairs
2.  Cabinet Committee on Natural Calamities
3.  Cabinet Committee on Parliamentary Affairs
4.  Appointments Committee of the Cabinet
5.  Cabinet Committee on Accommodation
6.  Cabinet Committee on Foreign Investment
7.  Cabinet Committee on Drug Abuse Control
8.  Cabinet Committee on Prices
9.  Cabinet Committee on Minority Welfare
10.  Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs
11.  Cabinet Committee on Trade and Investment
12.  Cabinet Committee on Expenditure
13.  Cabinet Committee on Infrastructure
In 2013, the following 10 Cabinet Committees were in existence:
1.  Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs
2.  Cabinet Committee on Prices
3.  Cabinet Committee on Political Affairs
4.  Appointments Committee of the Cabinet
5.  Cabinet Committee on Security
6.  Cabinet Committee on World Trade Organisation (WTO) Matters
7.  Cabinet Committee on Investment
8.  Cabinet Committee on Unique Identification Authority of India
(UIDAI) related issues
9.  Cabinet Committee on Parliamentary Affairs
10.  Cabinet Committee on Accommodation
At present (2019), the following 8 Cabinet Committees are functional:
1.  Cabinet Committee on Political Affairs
2.  Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs
3.  Appointments Committee of the Cabinet
4.  Cabinet Committee on Security
5.  Cabinet Committee on Parliamentary Affairs
6.  Cabinet Committee on Accommodation
7.  Cabinet Committee on Investment and Growth
8.  Cabinet Committee on Employment and Skill Development
FUNCTIONS OF CABINET COMMITTEES
The following four are the more important cabinet committees:
1.  The Political Affairs Committee deals with all policy matters
pertaining to domestic and foreign affairs.
2.  The Economic Affairs Committee directs and coordinates the
governmental activities in the economic sphere.
3.  Appointments Committee decides all higher level appointments in
the Central Secretariat, Public Enterprises, Banks and Financial
Institutions.
4.  Parliamentary Affairs Committee looks after the progress of
government business in the Parliament.
The first three committees are chaired by the Prime Minister and the last
one by the Home Minister. Of all the Cabinet Committees, the most
powerful is the Political Affairs Committee, often described as a “SuperCabinet”.
GROUPS OF MINISTERS
In addition to cabinet committees, several Groups of Ministers (GoMs) are
constituted to look into different issues / subjects. Some of these GoMs are
empowered to take decisions on behalf of the Cabinet whereas the others
make recommendations to the Cabinet.2
The institution of GoMs has become a viable and effective instrument of
coordination among the ministries. These are ad hoc bodies formed to give
recommendations to the cabinet on certain emergent issues and critical
problem areas. Ministers heading the concerned ministries are inducted into
the relevant GoMs and when the advice is crystallised they are disbanded.3
The Second Administrative Reforms Commission (2005–2009) made the
following observations and recommendations with respect to the working of
the GoMs4
 :
1.  The Commission observed that the constitution of a large number
of GoMs has resulted in many GoMs not being able to meet regularly
to complete their work thus leading to significant delays on many
major issues.
2.  The Commission felt that more selective use of the institution of
GoMs would perhaps lead to more effective coordination particularly
if they are empowered to arrive at a decision on behalf of the Cabinet
with time limits that are prescribed for completing the work entrusted
to them.
3.  The Commission recommended that there is need to ensure that the
existing coordination mechanism of GoMs function effectively and
helps in early resolution of issues. Selective, but effective use of GoMs
with clear mandate and prescribed time limits would be helpful.

22 Parliament
The Parliament is the legislative organ of the Union government. It
occupies a pre-eminent and central position in the Indian democratic
political system due to adoption of the parliamentary form of government,
also known as ‘Westminster’ model of government1
 .
Articles 79 to 122 in Part V of the Constitution deal with the
organisation, composition, duration, officers, procedures, privileges, powers
and so on of the Parliament.
ORGANISATION OF PARLIAMENT
Under the Constitution, the Parliament of India consists of three parts viz,
the President, the Council of States and the House of the People. In 1954,
the Hindi names ‘Rajya Sabha’ and ‘Lok Sabha’ were adopted by the
Council of States and the House of People respectively. The Rajya Sabha is
the Upper House (Second Chamber or House of Elders) and the Lok Sabha
is the Lower House (First Chamber or Popular House). The former
represents the states and union territories of the Indian Union, while the
latter represents the people of India as a whole.
Though the President of India is not a member of either House of
Parliament and does not sit in the Parliament to attend its meetings, he is an
integral part of the Parliament. This is because a bill passed by both the
Houses of Parliament cannot become law without the President’s assent. He
also performs certain functions relating to the proceedings of the
Parliament, for example, he summons and pro-rogues both the Houses,
dissolves the Lok Sabha, addresses both the Houses, issues ordinances
when they are not in session, and so on.
In this respect, the framers of the Indian Constitution relied on the British
pattern rather than the American pattern. In Britain, the Parliament consists
of the Crown (King or Queen), the House of Lords (Upper House) and the
House of Commons (Lower House). By contrast, the American president is
not an integral part of the legislature. In USA, the legislature, which is
known as Congress, consists of the Senate (Upper House) and the House of
Representatives (Lower House).
The parliamentary form of government emphasises on the
interdependence between the legislative and executive organs. Hence, we
have the ‘President-in-Parliament’ like the ‘Crown-in-Parliament’ in
Britain. The presidential form of government, on the other hand, lays stress
on the separation of legislative and executive organs. Hence, the American
president is not regarded as a constituent part of the Congress.
COMPOSITION OF THE TWO HOUSES
Composition of Rajya Sabha
The maximum strength of the Rajya Sabha is fixed at 250, out of which,
238 are to be the representatives of the states and union territories (elected
indirectly) and 12 are nominated by the president.
At present, the Rajya Sabha has 245 members. Of these, 229 members
represent the states, 4 members represent the union territories and 12
members are nominated by the president.
The Fourth Schedule of the Constitution deals with the allocation of seats
in the Rajya Sabha to the states and union territories2
 .
1. Representation of States
The representatives of states in the Rajya Sabha are elected by the elected
members of state legislative assemblies. The election is held in accordance
with the system of proportional representation by means of the single
transferable vote. The seats are allotted to the states in the Rajya Sabha on
the basis of population. Hence, the number of representatives varies from
state to state. For example, Uttar Pradesh has 31 members while Tripura has
1 member only. However, in USA, all states are given equal representation
in the Senate irrespective of their population. USA has 50 states and the
Senate has 100 members–2 from each state.
2. Representation of Union Territories
The representatives of each union territory in the Rajya Sabha are indirectly
elected by members of an electoral college specially constituted for the
purpose. This election is also held in accordance with the system of
proportional representation by means of the single transferable vote. Out of
the nine union territories, only three (Delhi, Puducherry and Jammu &
Kashmir) have representation in Rajya Sabha. The populations of other six
union territories are too small to have any representative in the Rajya
Sabha.
3. Nominated Members
The president nominates 12 members to the Rajya Sabha from people who
have special knowledge or practical experience in art, literature, science and
social service. The rationale behind this principle of nomination is to
provide eminent persons a place in the Rajya Sabha without going through
the process of election. It should be noted here that the American Senate
has no nominated members.
Composition of Lok Sabha
The maximum strength of the Lok Sabha is fixed at 552. Out of this, 530
members are to be the representatives of the states, 20 members are to be
the representatives of the union territories and 2 members are to be
nominated by the president from the Anglo-Indian community3
 .
At present, the Lok Sabha has 545 members. Of these, 530 members
represent the states, 13 members represent the union territories and 2
Anglo-Indian members are nominated by the President4
 .
1. Representation of States
The representatives of states in the Lok Sabha are directly elected by the
people from the territorial constituencies in the states. The election is based
on the principle of universal adult franchise. Every Indian citizen who is
above 18 years of age and who is not disqualified under the provisions of
the Constitution or any law is eligible to vote at such election. The voting
age was reduced from 21 to 18 years by the 61st Constitutional Amendment
Act, 1988.
2. Representation of Union Territories
The Constitution has empowered the Parliament to prescribe the manner of
choosing the representatives of the union territories in the Lok Sabha.
Accordingly, the Parliament has enacted the Union Territories (Direct
Election to the House of the People) Act, 1965, by which the members of
Lok Sabha from the union territories are also chosen by direct election.
3. Nominated Members
The president can nominate two members from the Anglo-Indian
community if the community is not adequately represented in the Lok
Sabha. Originally, this provision was to operate till 1960 but has been
extended till 2020 by the 95th Amendment Act, 2009.
SYSTEM OF ELECTIONS TO LOK SABHA
The various aspects related to the system of elections to the Lok Sabha are
as follows:
Territorial Constituencies
For the purpose of holding direct elections to the Lok Sabha, each state is
divided into territorial constituencies. In this respect, the Constitution
makes the following two provisions:
1.  Each state is allotted a number of seats in the Lok Sabha in such a
manner that the ratio between that number and its population is the
same for all states. This provision does not apply to a state having a
population of less than six millions.
2.  Each state is divided into territorial constituencies in such a manner
that the ratio between the population of each constituency and the
number of seats allotted to it is the same throughout the state.
In brief, the Constitution ensures that there is uniformity of
representation in two respects: (a) between the different states, and b)
between the different constituencies in the same state.
The expression ‘population’ means the population as ascertained at the
preceding census of which the relevant figures have been published.
Readjustment after each Census
After every census, a readjustment is to be made in (a) allocation of seats in
the Lok Sabha to the states, and (b) division of each state into territorial
constituencies. Parliament is empowered to determine the authority and the
manner in which it is to be made. Accordingly, the Parliament has enacted
the Delimitation Commission Acts in 1952, 1962, 1972 and 2002 for this
purpose.
The 42nd Amendment Act of 1976 froze the allocation of seats in the
Lok Sabha to the states and the division of each state into territorial
constituencies till the year 2000 at the 1971 level. This ban on readjustment
was extended for another 25 years (ie, upto year 2026) by the 84th
Amendment Act of 2001, with the same objective of encouraging
population limiting measures.
The 84th Amendment Act of 2001 also empowered the government to
undertake readjustment and rationalisation of territorial constituencies in
the states on the basis of the population figures of 1991 census. Later, the
87th Amendment Act of 2003 provided for the delimitation of
constituencies on the basis of 2001 census and not 1991 census. However,
this can be done without altering the number of seats allotted to each state
in the Lok Sabha.
Reservation of Seats for SCs and STs
Though the Constitution has abandoned the system of communal
representation, it provides for the reservation of seats for scheduled castes
and scheduled tribes in the Lok Sabha on the basis of population ratios5
 .
Originally, this reservation was to operate for ten years (ie, up to 1960),
but it has been extended continuously since then by 10 years each time.
Now, under the 95th Amendment Act of 2009, this reservation is to last
until 2020.
Though seats are reserved for scheduled castes and scheduled tribes, they
are elected by all the voters in a constituency, without any separate
electorate. A member of scheduled castes and scheduled tribes is also not
debarred from contesting a general (non-reserved) seat.
The 84th Amendment Act of 2001 provided for refixing of the reserved
seats on the basis of the population figures of 1991 census as applied to
rationalisation of the general seats. Later, the 87th Amendment Act of 2003
provided for the refixing of the reserved seats on the basis of 2001 census
and not 1991 census.
First-Past-The-Post System
Though the Constitution has adopted the system of proportional
representation in the case of Rajya Sabha, it has not preferred the same
system in the case of Lok Sabha. Instead, it has adopted the system of
territorial representation (First-past-the-post system) for the election of
members to the Lok Sabha.
Under territorial representation, every member of the legislature
represents a geographical area known as a constituency. From each
constituency, only one representative is elected. Hence such a constituency
is known as single-member constituency. In this system, a candidate who
secures majority of votes is declared elected. This simple majority system
of representation does not represent the whole electorate. In other words, it
does not secure due representation to minorities (small groups).
The system of proportional representation aims at removing the defects
of territorial representation. Under this system, all sections of the people get
representation in proportion to their number. Even the smallest section of
the population gets its due share of representation in the legislature.
There are two kinds of proportional representation, namely, single
transferable vote system and list system. In India, the first kind is adopted
for the election of members to the Rajya Sabha and state legislative council
and for electing the President and the Vice-President.
Though some members of the Constituent Assembly had advocated the
system of proportional representation for the election of members to the
Lok Sabha, the Constitution has not adopted the system due to two reasons.
1.  Difficulty for the voters to understand the system (which is
complicated) due to low literacy scale in the country.
2.  Unsuitability to the parliamentary government due to the tendency
of the system to multiply political parties leading to instability in
government.
Additionally, the system of proportional representation has the following
demerits:
1.  It is highly expensive.
2.  It does not give any scope for organising by-elections.
3.  It eliminates intimate contacts between voters and representatives.
4.  It promotes minority thinking and group interests.
5.  It increases the significance of party system and decreases that of
voter.
DURATION OF TWO HOUSES
Duration of Rajya Sabha
The Rajya Sabha (first constituted in 1952) is a continuing chamber, that is,
it is a permanent body and not subject to dissolution. However, one-third of
its members retire every second year. Their seats are filled up by fresh
elections and presidential nominations at the beginning of every third year.
The retiring members are eligible for re-election and renomination any
number of times.
The Constitution has not fixed the term of office of members of the Rajya
Sabha and left it to the Parliament. Accordingly, the Parliament in the
Representation of the People Act (1951) provided that the term of office of
a member of the Rajya Sabha shall be six years. The act also empowered
the president of India to curtail the term of members chosen in the first
Rajya Sabha. In the first batch, it was decided by lottery as to who should
retire. Further, the act also authorised the President to make provisions to
govern the order of retirement of the members of the Rajya Sabha6
 .
Duration of Lok Sabha
Unlike the Rajya Sabha, the Lok Sabha is not a continuing chamber. Its
normal term is five years from the date of its first meeting after the general
elections, after which it automatically dissolves. However, the President is
authorised to dissolve the Lok Sabha at any time even before the
completion of five years and this cannot be challenged in a court of law.
Further, the term of the Lok Sabha can be extended during the period of
national emergency be a law of Parliament for one year at a time7
for any
length of time. However, this extension cannot continue beyond a period of
six months after the emergency has ceased to operate.
MEMBERSHIP OF PARLIAMENT
Qualifications
The Constitution lays down the following qualifications for a person to be
chosen a member of the Parliament:
1.  He must be a citizen of India.
2.  He must make and subscribe to an oath or affirmation before the
person authorised by the election commission for this purpose. In his
oath or affirmation, he swears
(a)  To bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of India
(b)  To uphold the sovereignty and integrity of India
3.  He must be not less than 30 years of age in the case of the Rajya
Sabha and not less than 25 years of age in the case of the Lok Sabha.
4.  He must posses other qualifications prescribed by Parliament.
The Parliament has laid down the following additional qualifications in
the Representation of People Act (1951).
1.  He must be registered as an elector for a parliamentary
constituency. This is same in the case of both, the Rajya Sabha and the
Lok Sabha. The requirement that a candidate contesting an election to
the Rajya Sabha from a particular state should be an elector in that
particular state was dispensed with in 2003. In 2006, the Supreme
Court upheld the constitutional validity of this change.
2.  He must be a member of a scheduled caste or scheduled tribe in any
state or union territory, if he wants to contest a seat reserved for them.
However, a member of scheduled castes or scheduled tribes can also
contest a seat not reserved for them.
Disqualifications
Under the Constitution, a person shall be disqualified for being elected as a
member of Parliament:
1.  if he holds any office of profit under the Union or state government
(except that of a minister or any other office exempted by Parliament).8
2.  if he is of unsound mind and stands so declared by a court.
3.  if he is an undischarged insolvent.
4.  if he is not a citizen of India or has voluntarily acquired the
citizenship of a foreign state or is under any acknowledgement of
allegiance to a foreign state; and
5.  if he is so disqualified under any law made by Parliament.
The Parliament has laid down the following additional disqualifications
in the Representation of People Act (1951):
1.  He must not have been found guilty of certain election offences or
corrupt practices in the elections.
2.  He must not have been convicted for any offence resulting in
imprisonment for two or more years. But, the detention of a person
under a preventive detention law is not a disqualification.
3.  He must not have failed to lodge an account of his election
expenses within the time.
4.  He must not have any interest in government contracts, works or
services.
5.  He must not be a director or managing agent nor hold an office of
profit in a corporation in which the government has at least 25 per cent
share.
6.  He must not have been dismissed from government service for
corruption or disloyalty to the State.
7.  He must not have been convicted for promoting enmity between
different groups or for the offence of bribery.
8.  He must not have been punished for preaching and practising social
crimes such as untouchability, dowry and sati.
On the question whether a member is subject to any of the above
disqualifications, the president’s decision is final. However, he should
obtain the opinion of the election commission and act accordingly.
Disqualification on Ground of Defection
The Constitution also lays down that a person shall be disqualified from
being a member of Parliament if he is so disqualified on the ground of
defection under the provisions of the Tenth Schedule. A member incurs
disqualification under the defection law:
1.  if he voluntary gives up the membership of the political party on
whose ticket he is elected to the House;
2.  if he votes or abstains from voting in the House contrary to any
direction given by his political party;
3.  if any independently elected member joins any political party; and
4.  if any nominated member joins any political party after the expiry
of six months.
The question of disqualification under the Tenth Schedule is decided by
the Chairman in the case of Rajya Sabha and Speaker in the case of Lok
Sabha (and not by the president of India). In 1992, the Supreme Court ruled
that the decision of the Chairman/ Speaker in this regard is subject to
judicial review.
Vacating of Seats
In the following cases, a member of Parliament vacates his seat.
1. Double Membership
A person cannot be a member of both Houses of Parliament at the same
time. Thus, the Representation of People Act (1951) provides for the
following:
(a)  If a person is elected to both the Houses of Parliament, he must
intimate within 10 days in which House he desires to serve. In default
of such intimation, his seat in the Rajya Sabha becomes vacant.
(b)  If a sitting member of one House is also elected to the other
House, his seat in the first House becomes vacant.
(c)  If a person is elected to two seats in a House, he should exercise
his option for one. Otherwise, both seats become vacant.
Similarly, a person cannot be a member of both the Parliament and the
state legislature at the same time. If a person is so elected, his seat in
Parliament becomes vacant if he does not resign his seat in the state
legislature within 14 days9
 .
2. Disqualification
If a member of Parliament becomes subject to any of the disqualifications
specified in the Constitution, his seat becomes vacant. Here, the list of
disqualifications also include the disqualification on the grounds of
defection under the provisions of the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution.
3. Resignation
A member may resign his seat by writing to the Chairman of Rajya Sabha
or Speaker of Lok Sabha, as the case may be. The seat falls vacant when the
resignation is accepted. However, the Chairman/ Speaker may not accept
the resignation if he is satisfied that it is not voluntary or genuine.
4. Absence
A House can declare the seat of a member vacant if he is absent from all its
meetings for a period of sixty days without its permission. In computing the
period of sixty days, no account shall be taken of any period during which
the House is prorogued or adjourned for more than four consecutive days.
5. Other cases
A member has to vacate his seat in the Parliament:
(a)  if his election is declared void by the court;
(b)  if he is expelled by the House;
(c)  if he is elected to the office of President or Vice-President; and
(d)  if he is appointed to the office of governor of a state.
If a disqualified person is elected to the Parliament, the Constitution lays
down no procedure to declare the election void. This matter is dealt by the
Representation of the People Act (1951), which enables the high court to
declare an election void if a disqualified candidate is elected. The aggrieved
party can appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the high court in
this regard.
Oath or Affirmation
Every member of either House of Parliament, before taking his seat in the
House, has to make and subscribe to an oath or affirmation before the
President or some person appointed by him for this purpose. In his oath or
affirmation, a member of Parliament swears:
1.  to bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of India;
2.  to uphold the sovereignty and integrity of India; and
3.  to faithfully discharge the duty upon which he is about to enter.
Unless a member takes the oath, he cannot vote and participate in the
proceedings of the House and does not become eligible to parliamentary
privileges and immunities.
A person is liable to a penalty of ₹500 for each day he sits or votes as a
member in a House in the following conditions:
1.  Before taking and subscribing to the prescribed oath or affirmation;
or
2.  When he knows that he is not qualified or that he is disqualified for
its membership; or
3.  When he knows that he is prohibited from sitting or voting in the
House by virtue of any parliamentary law.
Salaries and Allowances
Members of either House of Parliament are entitled to receive such salaries
and allowances as may be determined by Parliament, and there is no
provision of pension in the Constitution. However, Parliament has provided
pension to the members.
In 1954, the Parliament enacted the Salaries, Allowances and Pension of
Members of Parliament Act. In 2018, the salary of members was increased
from ₹50,000 to ₹1,00,000 per month, the constituency allowance from
₹45,000 to ₹70,000 per month and the office expenses allowance from
₹45,000 to ₹60,000 per month. Earlier in 2010, the daily allowance was
increased from ₹1,000 to ₹2,000 for each day of residence on duty.
From 1976, the members are also entitled to a pension on a graduated
scale for each five-year-term as members of either House of Parliament.
Besides, they are provided with travelling facilities, free accommodation,
telephone, vehicle advance, medical facilities and so on.
The salaries and allowances of the Speaker and Deputy Speaker of Lok
Sabha and the Chairman and Deputy Chairman of Rajya Sabha are also
determined by Parliament. They are charged on the Consolidated Fund of
India and thus are not subject to the annual vote of Parliament.
In 1953, the Parliament enacted the Salaries and Allowances of Officers
of Parliament Act. Under this Act, “Officer of Parliament” means any of the
following officers, namely, the Chairman and Deputy Chairman of the
Rajya Sabha and the Speaker and the Deputy Speaker of the Lok Sabha. In
2018, the Parliament increased the salary of the Chairman of the Rajya
Sabha from ₹1.25 lakh to ₹4 lakh per month9a
. Similarly, other Officers of
Parliament (i.e., the Speaker and the Deputy Speaker of the Lok Sabha and
the Deputy Chairman of the Rajya Sabha) are entitled to receive a salary per
month at the same rates as are payable to the Members of Parliament.9b
Further, each Officer of Parliament (other than the Chairman of the Rajya
Sabha) is entitled to receive a daily allowance (for each day during the
whole of his term) at the same rate as is payable to the Members of
Parliament.9c Also, each Officer of Parliament (other than the Chairman of
the Rajya Sabha) is entitled to receive a constituency allowance at the same
rate as is payable to the Members of Parliament.9d
According to the same Act, the sumptuary allowance is paid to the
Speaker of the Lok Sabha at the same rate as is payable to a Cabinet
Minister9e
(i.e., ₹2,000 per month). Likewise, the sumptuary allowance is
paid to the Deputy Speaker of the Lok Sabha and the Deputy Chairman of
the Rajya Sabha at the same rate as is payable to a Minister of State9f
(i.e.,
₹1000 per month).
PRESIDING OFFICERS OF PARLIAMENT
Each House of Parliament has its own presiding officer. There is a Speaker
and a Deputy Speaker for the Lok Sabha and a Chairman and a Deputy
Chairman for the Rajya Sabha. A panel of chairpersons for the Lok Sabha
and a panel of vice-chairpersons for the Rajya Sabha is also appointed.
Speaker of Lok Sabha
Election and Tenure
The Speaker is elected by the Lok Sabha from amongst its members (as
soon as may be, after its first sitting). Whenever the office of the Speaker
falls vacant, the Lok Sabha elects another member to fill the vacancy. The
date of election of the Speaker is fixed by the President.
Usually, the Speaker remains in office during the life of the Lok Sabha.
However, he has to vacate his office earlier in any of the following three
cases:
1.  if he ceases to be a member of the Lok Sabha;
2.  if he resigns by writing to the Deputy Speaker; and
3.  if he is removed by a resolution passed by a majority of all then
members of the Lok Sabha. Such a resolution can be moved only after
giving 14 days’ advance notice.
When a resolution for the removal of the Speaker is under consideration
of the House, he cannot preside at the sitting of the House, though he may
be present. However, he can speak and take part in the proceedings of the
House at such a time and vote in the first instance, though not in the case of
an equality of votes.
It should be noted here that, whenever the Lok Sabha is dissolved, the
Speaker does not vacate his office and continues till the newly-elected Lok
Sabha meets.
Role, Powers and Functions
The Speaker is the head of the Lok Sabha, and its representative. He is the
guardian of powers and privileges of the members, the House as a whole
and its committees. He is the principal spokesman of the House, and his
decision in all Parliamentary matters is final. He is thus much more than
merely the presiding officer of the Lok Sabha. In these capacities, he is
vested with vast, varied and vital responsibilities and enjoys great honour,
high dignity and supreme authority within the House.
The Speaker of the Lok Sabha derives his powers and duties from three
sources, that is, the Constitution of India, the Rules of Procedure and
Conduct of Business of Lok Sabha, and Parliamentary Conventions
(residuary powers that are unwritten or unspecified in the Rules).
Altogether, he has the following powers and duties:
1.  He maintains order and decorum in the House for conducting its
business and regulating its proceedings. This is his primary
responsibility and he has final power in this regard.
2.  He is the final interpreter of the provisions of (a) the Constitution of
India, (b) the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business of Lok
Sabha, and (c) the parliamentary precedents, within the House.
3.  He adjourns the House or suspends the meeting in absence of a
quorum. The quorum to constitute a meeting of the House is one-tenth
of the total strength of the House.
4.  He does not vote in the first instance. But he can exercise a casting
vote in the case of a tie. In other words, only when the House is
divided equally on any question, the Speaker is entitled to vote. Such
vote is called casting vote, and its purpose is to resolve a deadlock.
5.  He presides over a joint setting of the two Houses of Parliament.
Such a sitting is summoned by the President to settle a deadlock
between the two Houses on a bill.
6.  He can allow a ‘secret’ sitting of the House at the request of the
Leader of the House. When the House sits in secret, no stranger can be
present in the chamber, lobby or galleries except with the permission
of the Speaker.
7.  He decides whether a bill is a money bill or not and his decision on
this question is final. When a money bill is transmitted to the Rajya
Sabha for recommendation and presented to the President for assent,
the Speaker endorses on the bill his certificate that it is a money bill.
8.  He decides the questions of disqualification of a member of the Lok
Sabha, arising on the ground of defection under the provisions of the
Tenth Schedule. In 1992, the Supreme Court ruled that the decision of
the Speaker in this regard is subject to judicial review10
 .
9.  He acts as the ex-officio chairman of the Indian Parliamentary
Group which is a link between the Parliament of India and the various
parliaments of the world. He also acts as the ex-officio chairman of the
conference of presiding officers of legislative bodies in the country.
10.  He appoints the chairman of all the parliamentary committees of
the Lok Sabha and supervises their functioning. He himself is the
chairman of the Business Advisory Committee, the Rules Committee
and the General Purpose Committee.
Independence and Impartiality
As the office of the Speaker is vested with great prestige, position and
authority, independence and impartiality becomes its sine qua non11
 .
The following provisions ensure the independence and impartiality of the
office of the Speaker:
1.  He is provided with a security of tenure. He can be removed only
by a resolution passed by the Lok Sabha by a special majority (ie, a
majority of all the then members of the House) and not by an ordinary
majority (ie, a majority of the members present and voting in the
House). This motion of removal can be considered and discussed only
when it has the support of at least 50 members.
2.  His salaries and allowances are fixed by Parliament. They are
charged on the Consolidated Fund of India and thus are not subject to
the annual vote of Parliament.
3.  His work and conduct cannot be discussed and criticised in the Lok
Sabha except on a substantive motion.
4.  His powers of regulating procedure or conducting business or
maintaining order in the House are not subject to the jurisdiction of
any Court.
5.  He cannot vote in the first instance. He can only exercise a casting
vote in the event of a tie. This makes the position of Speaker impartial.
6.  He is given a very high position in the order of precedence. He is
placed at seventh rank, along with the Chief Justice of India. This
means, he has a higher rank than all cabinet ministers, except the
Prime Minister or Deputy Prime Minister.
In Britain, the Speaker is strictly a nonparty man. There is a convention
that the Speaker has to resign from his party and remain politically neutral.
This healthy convention is not fully established in India where the Speaker
does not resign from the membership of his party on his election to the
exalted office.
Deputy Speaker of Lok Sabha
Like the Speaker, the Deputy Speaker is also elected by the Lok Sabha itself
from amongst its members. He is elected after the election of the Speaker
has taken place. The date of election of the Deputy Speaker is fixed by the
Speaker. Whenever the office of the Deputy Speaker falls vacant, the Lok
Sabha elects another member to fill the vacancy.
Like the Speaker, the Deputy Speaker remains in office usually during
the life of the Lok Sabha. However, he may vacate his office earlier in any
of the following three cases:
1.  if he ceases to be a member of the Lok Sabha;
2.  if he resigns by writing to the Speaker; and
3.  if he is removed by a resolution passed by a majority of all the then
members of the Lok Sabha. Such a resolution can be moved only after
giving 14 days’ advance notice.
The Deputy Speaker performs the duties of the Speaker’s office when it
is vacant. He also acts as the Speaker when the latter is absent from the
sitting of the House. In both the cases, he assumes all the powers of the
Speaker. He also presides over the joint sitting of both the Houses of
Parliament, in case the Speaker is absent from such a sitting.
It should be noted here that the Deputy Speaker is not subordinate to the
Speaker. He is directly responsible to the House.
The Deputy Speaker has one special privilege, that is, whenever he is
appointed as a member of a parliamentary committee, he automatically
becomes its chairman.
Like the Speaker, the Deputy Speaker, while presiding over the House,
cannot vote in the first instance; he can only exercise a casting vote in the
case of a tie. Further, when a resolution for the removal of the Deputy
Speaker is under consideration of the House, he cannot preside at the sitting
of the House, though he may be present.
When the Speaker presides over the House, the Deputy Speaker is like
any other ordinary member of the House. He can speak in the House,
participate in its proceedings and vote on any question before the House.
The Deputy Speaker is entitled to a regular salary and allowance fixed by
Parliament, and charged on the Consolidated Fund of India.
Upto the 10th Lok Sabha, both the Speaker and the Deputy Speaker were
usually from the ruling party. Since the 11th Lok Sabha, there has been a
consensus that the Speaker comes from the ruling party (or ruling alliance)
and the post of Deputy Speaker goes to the main opposition party.
The Speaker and the Deputy Speaker, while assuming their offices, do
not make and subscribe any separate oath or affirmation.
The institutions of Speaker and Deputy Speaker originated in India in
1921 under the provisions of the Government of India Act of 1919
(Montague-Chelmsford Reforms). At that time, the Speaker and the Deputy
Speaker were called the President and Deputy President respectively and
the same nomenclature continued till 1947. Before 1921, the GovernorGeneral of India used to preside over the meetings of the Central
Legislative Council. In 1921, the Frederick Whyte and Sachidanand Sinha
were appointed by the Governor-General of India as the first Speaker and
the first Deputy Speaker (respectively) of the central legislative assembly.
In 1925, Vithalbhai J. Patel became the first Indian and the first elected
Speaker of the central legislative assembly. The Government of India Act of
1935 changed the nomenclatures of President and Deputy President of the
Central Legislative Assembly to the Speaker and Deputy Speaker
respectively. However, the old nomenclature continued till 1947 as the
federal part of the 1935 Act was not implemented. G.V. Mavalankar and
Ananthasayanam Ayyangar had the distinction of being the first Speaker
and the first Deputy Speaker (respectively) of the Lok Sabha. G.V.
Mavalankar also held the post of Speaker in the Constituent Assembly
(Legislative) as well as the provisional Parliament. He held the post of
Speaker of Lok Sabha continuously for one decade from 1946 to 1956.
Panel of Chairpersons of Lok Sabha
Under the Rules of Lok Sabha, the Speaker nominates from amongst the
members a panel of not more than ten chairpersons. Any of them can
preside over the House in the absence of the Speaker or the Deputy
Speaker. He has the same powers as the Speaker when so presiding. He
holds office until a new panel of chairpersons is nominated. When a
member of the panel of chairpersons is also not present, any other person as
determined by House acts as the Speaker.
It must be emphasised here that a member of the panel of chairpersons
cannot preside over the House, when the office of the Speaker or the
Deputy Speaker is vacant. During such time, the Speaker’s duties are to be
performed by such member of the House as the President may appoint for
the purpose. The elections are held, as soon as possible, to fill the vacant
posts.
Speaker Pro Tem
As provided by the Constitution, the Speaker of the last Lok Sabha vacates
his office immediately before the first meeting of the newly-elected Lok
Sabha. Therefore, the President appoints a member of the Lok Sabha as the
Speaker Pro Tem. Usually, the seniormost member is selected for this. The
President himself administers oath to the Speaker Pro Tem.
The Speaker Pro Tem has all the powers of the Speaker. He presides over
the first sitting of the newly-elected Lok Sabha. His main duty is to
administer oath to the new members. He also enables the House to elect the
new Speaker.
When the new Speaker is elected by the House, the office of the Speaker
Pro Tem ceases to exist. Hence, this office is a temporary office, existing for
a few days12
 .
Chairman of Rajya Sabha
The presiding officer of the Rajya Sabha is known as the Chairman. The
vice-president of India is the ex-officio Chairman of the Rajya Sabha.
During any period when the VicePresident acts as President or discharges
the functions of the President, he does not perform the duties of the office
of the Chairman of Rajya Sabha.
The Chairman of the Rajya Sabha can be removed from his office only if
he is removed from the office of the Vice-President. As a presiding officer,
the powers and functions of the Chairman in the Rajya Sabha are similar to
those of the Speaker in the Lok Sabha. However, the Speaker has two
special powers which are not enjoyed by the Chairman:
1.  The Speaker decides whether a bill is a money bill or not and his
decision on this question is final.
2.  The Speaker presides over a joint sitting of two Houses of
Parliament.
Unlike the Speaker (who is a member of the House), the Chairman is not
a member of the House. But like the Speaker, the Chairman also cannot
vote in the first instance. He too can cast a vote in the case of an equality of
votes.
The Vice-President cannot preside over a sitting of the Rajya Sabha as its
Chairman when a resolution for his removal is under consideration.
However, he can be present and speak in the House and can take part in its
proceedings, without voting, even at such a time (while the Speaker can
vote in the first instance when a resolution for his removal is under
consideration of the Lok Sabha).
As in case of the Speaker, the salaries and allowances of the Chairman
are also fixed by the Parliament. They are charged on the Consolidated
Fund of India and thus are not subject to the annual vote of Parliament.
During any period when the Vice-President acts as President or
discharges the functions of the President, he is not entitled to any salary or
allowance payable to the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha. But he is paid the
salary and allowance of the President during such a time.
Deputy Chairman of Rajya Sabha
The Deputy Chairman is elected by the Rajya Sabha itself from amongst its
members. Whenever the office of the Deputy Chairman falls vacant, the
Rajya Sabha elects another member to fill the vacancy.
The Deputy Chairman vacates his office in any of the following three
cases:
1.  if he ceases to be a member of the Rajya Sabha;
2.  if he resigns by writing to the Chairman; and
3.  if he is removed by a resolution passed by a majority of all the then
members of the Rajya Sabha. Such a resolution can be moved only
after giving 14 days’ advance notice.
The Deputy Chairman performs the duties of the Chairman’s office when
it is vacant or when the Vice-President acts as President or discharges the
functions of the President. He also acts as the Chairman when the latter is
absent from the sitting of the House. In both the cases, he has all the powers
of the Chairman.
It should be emphasised here that the Deputy Chairman is not
subordinate to the Chairman. He is directly responsible to the Rajya Sabha.
Like the Chairman, the Deputy Chairman, while presiding over the
House, cannot vote in the first instance; he can only exercise a casting vote
in the case of a tie. Further, when a resolution for the removal of the Deputy
Chairman is under consideration of the House, he cannot preside over a
sitting of the House, though he may be present.
When the Chairman presides over the House, the Deputy Chairman is
like any other ordinary member of the House. He can speak in the House,
participate in its proceedings and vote on any question before the House.
Like the Chairman, the Deputy Chairman is also entitled to a regular
salary and allowance. They are fixed by Parliament and are charged on the
Consolidated Fund of India.
Panel of Vice-Chairpersons of Rajya Sabha
Under the Rules of Rajya Sabha, the Chairman nominates from amongst the
members a panel of vice-chairpersons. Any one of them can preside over
the House in the absence of the Chairman or the Deputy Chairman. He has
the same powers as the Chairman when so presiding. He holds office until a
new panel of vice-chairpersons is nominated.
When a member of the panel of vicechairpersons is also not present, any
other person as determined by the House acts as the Chairman.
It must be emphasised here that a member of the panel of vicechairpersons cannot preside over the House, when the office of the
Chairman or the Deputy Chairman is vacant. During such time, the
Chairman’s duties are to be performed by such member of the House as the
president may appoint for the purpose. The elections are held, as soon as
possible, to fill the vacant posts.
Secretariat of Parliament
Each House of Parliament has separate secretarial staff of its own, though
there can be some posts common to both the Houses. Their recruitment and
service conditions are regulated by Parliament. The secretariat of each
House is headed by a secretary-general. He is a permanent officer and is
appointed by the presiding officer of the House.
LEADERS IN PARLIAMENT
Leader of the House
Under the Rules of Lok Sabha, the ‘Leader of the House’ means the prime
minister, if he is a member of the Lok Sabha, or a minister who is a member
of the Lok Sabha and is nominated by the prime minister to function as the
Leader of the House. There is also a ‘Leader of the House’ in the Rajya
Sabha. He is a minister and a member of the Rajya Sabha and is nominated
by the prime minister to function as such. The leader of the house in either
House is an important functionary and exercises direct influence on the
conduct of business. He can also nominate a deputy leader of the House.
The same functionary in USA is known as the ‘majority leader’.
Leader of the Opposition
In each House of Parliament, there is the ‘Leader of the Opposition’. The
leader of the largest Opposition party having not less than one-tenth seats of
the total strength of the House is recognised as the leader of the Opposition
in that House. In a parliamentary system of government, the leader of the
opposition has a significant role to play. His main functions are to provide a
constructive criticism of the policies of the government and to provide an
alternative government. Therefore, the leader of Opposition in the Lok
Sabha and the Rajya Sabha were accorded statutory recognition in 1977.
They are also entitled to the salary, allowances and other facilities
equivalent to that of a cabinet minister. It was in 1969 that an official leader
of the opposition was recognised for the first time. The same functionary in
USA is known as the ‘minority leader’.
The British political system has an unique institution called the ‘Shadow
Cabinet’. It is formed by the Opposition party to balance the ruling cabinet
and to prepare its members for future ministerial offices. In this shadow
cabinet, almost every member in the ruling cabinet is ‘shadowed’ by a
corresponding member in the opposition cabinet. This shadow cabinet
serves as the ‘alternate cabinet’ if there is change of government. That is
why Ivor Jennings described the leader of Opposition as the ‘alternative
Prime Minister’. He enjoys the status of a minister and is paid by the
government.
Whip
Though the offices of the leader of the House and the leader of the
Opposition are not mentioned in the Constitution of India, they are
mentioned in the Rules of the House and Parliamentary Statute respectively.
The office of ‘whip’, on the other hand, is mentioned neither in the
Constitution of India nor in the Rules of the House nor in a Parliamentary
Statute. It is based on the conventions of the parliamentary government.
Every political party, whether ruling or Opposition has its own whip in
the Parliament. He is appointed by the political party to serve as an assistant
floor leader. He is charged with the responsibility of ensuring the attendance
of his party members in large numbers and securing their support in favour
of or against a particular issue. He regulates and monitors their behaviour in
the Parliament. The members are supposed to follow the directives given by
the whip. Otherwise, disciplinary action can be taken.
SESSIONS OF PARLIAMENT
Summoning
The president from time to time summons each House of Parliament to
meet. But, the maximum gap between two sessions of Parliament cannot be
more than six months. In other words, the Parliament should meet at least
twice ayear. There are usually three sessions in a year, viz,
1.  the Budget Session (February to May);
2.  the Monsoon Session (July to September); and
3.  the Winter Session (November to December).
A ‘session’ of Parliament is the period spanning between the first sitting
of a House and its prorogation (or dissolution in the case of the Lok Sabha).
During a session, the House meets everyday to transact business. The
period spanning between the prorogation of a House and its reassembly in a
new session is called ‘recess’.
Adjournment
A session of Parliament consists of many meetings. Each meeting of a day
consists of two sittings, that is, a morning sitting from 11 am to 1 pm and
post-lunch sitting from 2 pm to 6 pm. A sitting of Parliament can be
terminated by adjournment or adjournment sine die or prorogation or
dissolution (in the case of the Lok Sabha). An adjournment suspends the
work in a sitting for a specified time, which may be hours, days or weeks.
Adjournment Sine Die
Adjournment sine die means terminating a sitting of Parliament for an
indefinite period. In other words, when the House is adjourned without
naming a day for reassembly, it is called adjournment sine die. The power
of adjournment as well as adjournment sine die lies with the presiding
officer of the House. He can also call a sitting of the House before the date
or time to which it has been adjourned or at any time after the House has
been adjourned sine die.
Prorogation
The presiding officer (Speaker or Chairman) declares the House adjourned
sine die, when the business of a session is completed. Within the next few
days, the President issues a notification for prorogation of the session.
However, the President can also prorogue the House while in session.
The specific differences between adjournment and prorogation are
summarised in Table 22.1.
Dissolution
Rajya Sabha, being a permanent House, is not subject to dissolution. Only
the Lok Sabha is subject to dissolution. Unlike a prorogation, a dissolution
ends the very life of the existing House, and a new House is constituted
after general elections are held. The dissolution of the Lok Sabha may take
place in either of two ways:
1.  Automatic dissolution, that is, on the expiry of its tenure of five
years or the terms as extended during a national emergency; or
2.  Whenever the President decides to dissolve the House, which he is
authorised to do. Once the Lok Sabha is dissolved before the
completion of its normal tenure, the dissolution is irrevocable.
When the Lok Sabha is dissolved, all business including bills, motions,
resolutions, notices, petitions and so on pending before it or its committees
lapse. They (to be pursued further) must be reintroduced in the newlyconstituted Lok Sabha. However, some pending bills and all pending
assurances that are to be examined by the Committee on Government
Assurances do not lapse on the dissolution of the Lok Sabha. The position
with respect to lapsing of bills is as follows:
1.  A bill pending in the Lok Sabha lapses (whether originating in the
Lok Sabha or transmitted to it by the Rajya Sabha).
2.  A bill passed by the Lok Sabha but pending in the Rajya Sabha
lapses.
3.  A bill not passed by the two Houses due to disagreement and if the
president has notified the holding of a joint sitting before the
dissolution of Lok Sabha, does not lapse.
4.  A bill pending in the Rajya Sabha but not passed by the Lok Sabha
does not lapse.
5.  A bill passed by both Houses but pending assent of the president
does not lapse.
6.  A bill passed by both Houses but returned by the president for
reconsideration of Houses does not lapse.
Table 22.1  Adjournment vs Prorogation
Adjournment Prorogation
1.  It only terminates a
sitting and not a
session of the
House. 
1.  It not only terminates a sitting but also a session
of the House. 
2.  It is done by
presiding officer of
the House. 
2.  It is done by the president of India. 
3.  It does not affect the
bills or any other
business pending
before the House
and the same can be
resumed when the
House meets again. 
3.  It also does not affect the bills or any other
business pending before the House. 13
 However,
all pending notices (other than those for
introducing bills) lapse on prorogation and
fresh notices have to be given for the next
session. In Britain, prorogation brings to an end
all bills or any other business pending before
the House.
Quorum
Quorum is the minimum number of members required to be present in the
House before it can transact any business. It is one-tenth of the total number
of members in each House including the presiding officer. It means that
there must be at least 55 members present in the Lok Sabha and 25
members present in the Rajya Sabha, if any business is to be conducted. If
there is no quorum during a meeting of the House, it is the duty of the
presiding officer either to adjourn the House or to suspend the meeting until
there is a quorum.
Voting in House
All matters at any sitting of either House or joint sitting of both the Houses
are decided by a majority of votes of the members present and voting,
excluding the presiding officer. Only a few matters, which are specifically
mentioned in the Constitution like impeachment of the President,
amendment of the Constitution, removal of the presiding officers of the
Parliament and so on, require special majority, not ordinary majority.
The presiding officer of a House does not vote in the first instance, but
exercises a casting vote in the case of an equality of votes. The proceedings
of a House are to be valid irrespective of any unauthorised voting or
participation or any vacancy in its membership.
The following points can be noted with respect to the voting procedure in
the Lok Sabha:
1.  On the conclusion of a debate, the Speaker shall put the question
and invite those who are in favour of the motion to say ‘Aye’ and those
against the motion to say ‘No’.
2.  The Speaker shall then say: ‘I think the Ayes (or the Noes, as the
case may be) have it.’ If the opinion of the Speaker as to the decision
of a question is not challenged, he shall say twice: The Ayes (or the
Noes, as the case may be) have it’ and the question before the House
shall be determined accordingly.
3.  (a) If the opinion of the Speaker as to the decision of a question is
challenged, he shall order that the Lobby be cleared.
(b)  After the lapse of three minutes and thirty seconds, he shall put the
question a second time and declare whether in his opinion the ‘Ayes’
or the ‘Noes’ have it.
(c)  If the opinion so declared is again challenged, he shall direct that
the votes be recorded either by operating the automatic vote recorder
or by using ‘Aye’ and ‘No’ Slips in the House or by the Members
going into the Lobbies.
4.  If in the opinion of the Speaker, the Division is unnecessarily
claimed, he may ask the members who are for ‘Aye’ and those for ‘No’
respectively to rise in their places and, on a count being taken, he may
declare the determination of the House. In such a case, the names of
the voters shall not be recorded.
Language in Parliament
The Constitution has declared Hindi and English to be the languages for
transacting business in the Parliament. However, the presiding officer can
permit a member to address the House in his mother-tongue. In both the
Houses, arrangements are made for simultaneous translation. Though
English was to be discontinued as a floor language after the expiration of
fifteen years from the commencement of the Constitution (that is, in 1965),
the Official Languages Act (1963) allowed English to be continued along
with Hindi.
Rights of Ministers and Attorney General
In addition to the members of a House, every minister and the attorney
general of India have the right to speak and take part in the proceedings of
either House, any joint sitting of both the Houses and any committee of
Parliament of which he is a member, without being entitled to vote. There
are two reasons underlying this constitutional provision:
1.  A minister can participate in the proceedings of a House, of which
he is not a member. In other words, a minister belonging to the Lok
Sabha can participate in the proceedings of the Rajya Sabha and viceversa.
2.  A minister, who is not a member of either House, can participate in
the proceedings of both the Houses. It should be noted here that a
person can remain a minister for six months, without being a member
of either House of Parliament.
Lame-duck Session
It refers to the last session of the existing Lok Sabha, after a new Lok Sabha
has been elected. Those members of the existing Lok Sabha who could not
get re-elected to the new Lok Sabha are called lame-ducks.
DEVICES OF PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS
Question Hour
The first hour of every parliamentary sitting is slotted for this. During this
time, the members ask questions and the ministers usually give answers.
The questions are of three kinds, namely, starred, unstarred and short notice.
A starred question (distinguished by an asterisk) requires an oral answer
and hence supplementary questions can follow.
An unstarred question, on the other hand, requires a written answer and
hence, supplementary questions cannot follow.
A short notice question is one that is asked by giving a notice of less
than ten days. It is answered orally.
In addition to the ministers, the questions can also be asked to the private
members. Thus, a question may be addressed to a private member if the
subject matter of the question relates to some Bill, resolution or other matter
connected with the business of the House for which that member is
responsible. The procedure in regard to such question is the same as that
followed in the case of questions addressed to a minister.
The list of starred, unstarred, short notice questions and questions to
private members are printed in green, white, light pink and yellow colour,
respectively, to distinguish them from one another.
Zero Hour
Unlike the question hour, the zero hour is not mentioned in the Rules of
Procedure. Thus it is an informal device available to the members of the
Parliament to raise matters without any prior notice. The zero hour starts
immediately after the question hour and lasts until the agenda for the day
(ie, regular business of the House) is taken up. In other words, the time gap
between the question hour and the agenda is known as zero hour. It is an
Indian innovation in the field of parliamentary procedures and has been in
existence since 1962.
Motions
No discussion on a matter of general public importance can take place
except on a motion made with the consent of the presiding officer. The
House expresses its decisions or opinions on various issues through the
adoption or rejection of motions moved by either ministers or private
members.
The motions moved by the members to raise discussions on various
matters fall into three principal categories:14
1.  Substantive Motion: It is a self-contained independent proposal
dealing with a very important matter like impeachment of the
President or removal of Chief Election Commissioner.
2.  Substitute Motion: It is a motion that is moved in substitution of an
original motion and proposes an alternative to it. If adopted by the
House, it supersedes the original motion.
3.  Subsidiary Motion: It is a motion that, by itself, has no meaning and
cannot state the decision of the House without reference to the original
motion or proceedings of the House. It is divided into three subcategories:
(a)  Ancillary Motion: It is used as the regular way of proceeding with
various kinds of business.
(b)  Superseding Motion: It is moved in the course of debate on
another issue and seeks to supersede that issue.
(c)  Amendment: It seeks to modify or substitute only a part of the
original motion.
Closure Motion
It is a motion moved by a member to cut short the debate on a matter before
the House. If the motion is approved by the House, debate is stopped
forthwith and the matter is put to vote. There are four kinds of closure
motions15
 :
(a)  Simple Closure: It is one when a member moves that the ‘matter
having been sufficiently discussed be now put to vote’.
(b)  Closure by Compartments: In this case, the clauses of a bill or a
lengthy resolution are grouped into parts before the commencement of
the debate. The debate covers the part as a whole and the entire part is
put to vote.
(c)  Kangaroo Closure: Under this type, only important clauses are
taken up for debate and voting and the intervening clauses are skipped
over and taken as passed.
(d)  Guillotine Closure: It is one when the undiscussed clauses of a bill
or a resolution are also put to vote along with the discussed ones due to
want of time (as the time allotted for the discussion is over).
Privilege Motion
It is concerned with the breach of parliamentary privileges by a minister. It
is moved by a member when he feels that a minister has committed a
breach of privilege of the House or one or more of its members by
withholding facts of a case or by giving wrong or distorted facts. Its
purpose is to censure the concerned minister.
Calling Attention Motion
It is introduced in the Parliament by a member to call the attention of a
minister to a matter of urgent public importance, and to seek an
authoritative statement from him on that matter. Like the zero hour, it is also
an Indian innovation in the parliamentary procedure and has been in
existence since 1954. However, unlike the zero hour, it is mentioned in the
Rules of Procedure.
Adjournment Motion
It is introduced in the Parliament to draw attention of the House to a
definite matter of urgent public importance, and needs the support of 50
members to be admitted. As it interrupts the normal business of the House,
it is regarded as an extraordinary device. It involves an element of censure
against the government and hence Rajya Sabha is not permitted to make use
of this device. The discussion on an adjournment motion should last for not
less than two hours and thirty minutes.
The right to move a motion for an adjournment of the business of the
House is subject to the following restrictions:
1.  It should raise a matter which is definite, factual, urgent and of
public importance;
2.  It should not cover more than one matter;
3.  It should be restricted to a specific matter of recent occurrence and
should not be framed in general terms;
4.  It should not raise a question of privilege;
5.  It should not revive discussion on a matter that has been discussed
in the same session;
6.  It should not deal with any matter that is under adjudication by
court; and
7.  It should not raise any question that can be raised on a distinct
motion.
No-Confidence Motion
Article 75 of the Constitution says that the council of ministers shall be
collectively responsible to the Lok Sabha. It means that the ministry stays in
office so long as it enjoys confidence of the majority of the members of the
Lok Sabha. In other words, the Lok Sabha can remove the ministry from
office by passing a no-confidence motion. The motion needs the support of
50 members to be admitted.
Confidence Motion
The motion of confidence has come up as a new procedural device to cope
with the emerging situations of fractured mandates resulting in hung
parliament, minority governments and coalition governments. The
governments formed with wafer-thin majority have been called upon by the
President to prove their majority on the floor of the House. The government
of the day, sometimes, on its own, seeks to prove its majority by moving a
motion of confidence and winning the confidence of the House. If the
confidence motion is negatived, it results in the fall of the government15a
.
Censure Motion
A censure motion is different from a no-confidence motion as shown in
Table 22.2.
Motion of Thanks
The first session after each general election and the first session of every
fiscal year is addressed by the president. In this address, the president
outlines the policies and programmes of the government in the preceding
year and ensuing year. This address of the president, which corresponds to
the ‘speech from the Throne in Britain’, is discussed in both the Houses of
Parliament on a motion called the ‘Motion of Thanks’. At the end of the
discussion, the motion is put to vote. This motion must be passed in the
House. Otherwise, it amounts to the defeat of the government. This
inaugural speech of the president is an occasion available to the members of
Parliament to raise discussions and debates to examine and criticise the
government and administration for its lapses and failures.
No-Day-Yet-Named Motion
It is a motion that has been admitted by the Speaker but no date has been
fixed for its discussion. The Speaker, after considering the state of business
in the House and in consultation with the leader of the House or on the
recommendation of the Business Advisory Committee, allots a day or days
or part of a day for the discussion of such a motion.
Dilatory Motion
It is a motion for the adjournment of the debate on a bill / motion /
resolution etc. or a motion to retard or delay the progress of a business
under consideration of the House. It can be moved by a member at any time
after a motion has been made. The debate on a dilatory motion must be
restricted to the matter contained in such motion. If the Speaker is of the
opinion that such a motion is an abuse of the rules of the House, he may
either forthwith put the question thereon or decline to propose the question.
Point of Order
A member can raise a point of order when the proceedings of the House do
not follow the normal rules of procedure. A point of order should relate to
the interpretation or enforcement of the Rules of the House or such articles
of the Constitution that regulate the business of the House and should raise
a question that is within the cognizance of the Speaker. It is usually raised
by an opposition member in order to control the government. It is an
extraordinary device as it suspends the proceedings before the House. No
debate is allowed on a point of order.
Table 22.2  Censure Motion vs No Confidence Motion
Censure Motion No-Confidence Motion
1.  It should state the reasons for
its adoption in the Lok Sabha.
1.  It need not state the
reasons for its adoption in
the Lok Sabha.
2.  It can be moved against an
individual minister or a group of
ministers or the entire council of
ministers.
2.  It can be moved against
the entire council of
ministers only.
3.  It is moved for censuring the
council of ministers for specific
policies and actions.
3.  It is moved for
ascertaining the confidence
of Lok Sabha in the council
of ministers.
4.  If it is passed in the Lok Sabha,
the council of ministers need not
resign from the office.
4.  If it is passed in the Lok
Sabha, the council of
ministers must resign from
office.
Half-an-Hour Discussion
It is meant for discussing a matter of sufficient public importance, which
has been subjected to a lot of debate and the answer to which needs
elucidation on a matter of fact. The Speaker can allot three days in a week
for such discussions. There is no formal motion or voting before the House.
Short Duration Discussion
It is also known as two-hour discussion as the time allotted for such a
discussion should not exceed two hours. The members of the Parliament
can raise such discussions on a matter of urgent public importance. The
Speaker can allot two days in a week for such discussions. There is neither
a formal motion before the house nor voting. This device has been in
existence since 1953.
Special Mention
A matter which is not a point of order or which cannot be raised during
question hour, half-an hour discussion, short duration discussion or under
adjournment motion, calling attention notice or under any rule of the House
can be raised under the special mention in the Rajya Sabha. Its equivalent
procedural device in the Lok Sabha is known as ‘Notice (Mention) Under
Rule 377’.
Resolutions
The members can move resolutions to draw the attention of the House or
the government to matters of general public interest. The discussion on a
resolution is strictly relevant to and within the scope of the resolution. A
member who has moved a resolution or amendment to a resolution cannot
withdraw the same except by leave of the House.
Resolutions are classified into three categories:16
1.  Private Member’s Resolution: It is one that is moved by a private
member (other than a minister). It is discussed only on alternate
Fridays and in the afternoon sitting.
2.  Government Resolution: It is one that is moved by a minister. It can
be taken up any day from Monday to Thursday.
3.  Statutory Resolution: It can be moved either by a private member
or a minister. It is so called because it is always tabled in pursuance of
a provision in the Constitution or an Act of Parliament.
Resolutions are different from motions in the following respects:
“All resolutions come in the category of substantive motions, that is to
say, every resolution is a particular type of motion. All motions need
not necessarily be substantive. Further, all motions are not necessarily
put to vote of the House, whereas all the resolutions are required to be
voted upon.”17
Youth Parliament
The scheme of Youth Parliament was started on the recommendation of the
Fourth All India Whips Conference. Its objectives are:
1.  to acquaint the younger generations with practices and procedures
of Parliament;
2.  to imbibe the spirit of discipline and tolerance cultivating character
in the minds of youth; and
3.  to inculcate in the student community the basic values of
democracy and to enable them to acquire a proper perspective on the
functioning of democratic institutions.
The ministry of parliamentary affairs provides necessary training and
encouragement to the states in introducing the scheme.
LEGISLATIVE PROCEDURE IN PARLIAMENT
The legislative procedure is identical in both the Houses of Parliament.
Every bill has to pass through the same stages in each House. A bill is a
proposal for legislation and it becomes an act or law when duly enacted.
Bills introduced in the Parliament are of two kinds: public bills and
private bills (also known as government bills and private members’ bills
respectively). Though both are governed by the same general procedure and
pass through the same stages in the House, they differ in various respects as
shown in Table 22.3.
The bills introduced in the Parliament can also be classified into four
categories:
1.  Ordinary bills, which are concerned with any matter other than
financial subjects.
2.  Money bills, which are concerned with the financial matters like
taxation, public expenditure, etc.
3.  Financial bills, which are also concerned with financial matters (but
are different from money bills).
4.  Constitution amendment bills, which are concerned with the
amendment of the provisions of the Constitution.
The Constitution has laid down separate procedures for the enactment of
all the four types of bills. The procedures with regard to ordinary bills,
money bills and financial bills are explained here. The procedure with
regard to Constitution amendment bills is explained in detail in Chapter 10.
Ordinary Bills
Every ordinary bill has to pass through the following five stages in the
Parliament before it finds a place on the Statute Book:
1. First Reading
An ordinary bill can be introduced in either House of Parliament. Such a
bill can be introduced either by a minister or by any other member. The
member who wants to introduce the bill has to ask for the leave of the
House. When the House grants leave to introduce the bill, the mover of the
bill introduces it by reading its title and objectives. No discussion on the bill
takes place at this stage. Later, the bill is published in the Gazette of India.
If a bill is published in the Gazette before its introduction, leave of the
House to introduce the bill is not necessary.
18 The introduction of the bill
and its publication in the Gazette constitute the first reading of the bill.
Table 22.3  Public Bill vs Private Bill
Public Bill Private Bill
1.  It is introduced in the Parliament by a
minister. 
1.  It is introduced by any
member of Parliament other
than a minister. 
2.  It reflects of the policies of the
government (ruling party). 
2.  It reflects the stand of
opposition party on public
matter. 
3.  It has greater chance to be approved
by the Parliament. 
3.  It has lesser chance to be
approved by the Parliament. 
4.  Its rejection by the House amounts to
the expression of want of
parliamentary confidence in the
government and may lead to its
resignation. 
4.  Its rejection by the House has
no implication on the
parliamentary confidence in
the government or its
resignation. 
5.  Its introduction in the House requires
seven days’ notice. 
5.  Its introduction in the House
requires one month’s notice. 
6.  It is drafted by the concerned
department in consultation with the
law department. 
6.  Its drafting is the
responsibility of the member
concerned. 
2. Second Reading
During this stage, the bill receives not only the general but also the detailed
scrutiny and assumes its final shape. Hence, it forms the most important
stage in the enactment of a bill. In fact, this stage involves three more substages, namely, stage of general discussion, committee stage and
consideration stage.
(a) Stage of General Discussion
The printed copies of the bill are distributed to all the members. The
principles of the bill and its provisions are discussed generally, but the
details of the bill are not discussed.
At this stage, the House can take any one of the following four actions:
(i) It may take the bill into consideration immediately or on some other
fixed date;
(ii) It may refer the bill to a select committee of the House;
(iii) It may refer the bill to a joint committee of the two Houses; and
(iv) It may circulate the bill to elicit public opinion.
A Select Committee consists of members of the House where the bill has
originated and a joint committee consists of members of both the Houses of
Parliament.
(b) Committee Stage
The usual practice is to refer the bill to a select committee of the House.
This committee examines the bill thoroughly and in detail, clause by clause.
It can also amend its provisions, but without altering the principles
underlying it. After completing the scrutiny and discussion, the committee
reports the bill back to the House.
(c) Consideration Stage
The House, after receiving the bill from the select committee, considers the
provisions of the bill clause by clause. Each clause is discussed and voted
upon separately. The members can also move amendments and if accepted,
they become part of the bill.
3. Third Reading
At this stage, the debate is confined to the acceptance or rejection of the bill
as a whole and no amendments are allowed, as the general principles
underlying the bill have already been scrutinised during the stage of second
reading. If the majority of members present and voting accept the bill, the
bill is regarded as passed by the House. Thereafter, the bill is authenticated
by the presiding officer of the House and transmitted to the second House
for consideration and approval. A bill is deemed to have been passed by the
Parliament only when both the Houses have agreed to it, either with or
without amendments.
4. Bill in the Second House
In the second House also, the bill passes through all the three stages, that is,
first reading, second reading and third reading. There are four alternatives
before this House:
(a)  it may pass the bill as sent by the first house (ie, without
amendments);
(b)  it may pass the bill with amendments and return it to the first
House for reconsideration;
(c)  it may reject the bill altogether; and
(d)  it may not take any action and thus keep the bill pending.
If the second House passes the bill without any amendments or the first
House accepts the amendments suggested by the second House, the bill is
deemed to have been passed by both the Houses and the same is sent to the
president for his assent. On the other hand, if the first House rejects the
amendments suggested by the second House or the second House rejects the
bill altogether or the second House does not take any action for six months,
a deadlock is deemed to have taken place. To resolve such a deadlock, the
president can summon a joint sitting of the two Houses. If the majority of
members present and voting in the joint sitting approves the bill, the bill is
deemed to have been passed by both the Houses.
5. Assent of the President
Every bill after being passed by both Houses of Parliament either singly or
at a joint sitting, is presented to the president for his assent. There are three
alternatives before the president:
(a)  he may give his assent to the bill; or
(b)  he may withhold his assent to the bill; or
(c)  he may return the bill for reconsideration of the Houses.
If the president gives his assent to the bill, the bill becomes an act and is
placed on the Statute Book. If the President withholds his assent to the bill,
it ends and does not become an act. If the President returns the bill for
reconsideration and if it is passed by both the Houses again with or without
amendments and presented to the President for his assent, the president
must give his assent to the bill. Thus, the President enjoys only a
“suspensive veto.”19
Money Bills
Article 110 of the Constitution deals with the definition of money bills. It
states that a bill is deemed to be a money bill if it contains ‘only’ provisions
dealing with all or any of the following matters:
1.  The imposition, abolition, remission, alteration or regulation of any
tax;
2.  The regulation of the borrowing of money by the Union
government;
3.  The custody of the Consolidated Fund of India or the contingency
fund of India, the payment of moneys into or the withdrawal of money
from any such fund;
4.  The appropriation of money out of the Consolidated Fund of India;
5.  Declaration of any expenditure charged on the Consolidated Fund
of India or increasing the amount of any such expenditure;
6.  The receipt of money on account of the Consolidated Fund of India
or the public account of India or the custody or issue of such money, or
the audit of the accounts of the Union or of a state; or
7.  Any matter incidental to any of the matters specified above.
However, a bill is not to be deemed to be a money bill by reason only
that it provides for:
1.  the imposition of fines or other pecuniary penalties, or
2.  the demand or payment of fees for licenses or fees for services
rendered; or
3.  the imposition, abolition, remission, alteration or regulation of any
tax by any local authority or body for local purposes.
If any question arises whether a bill is a money bill or not, the decision of
the Speaker of the Lok Sabha is final. His decision in this regard cannot be
questioned in any court of law or in the either House of Parliament or even
the president. When a money bill is transmitted to the Rajya Sabha for
recommendation and presented to the president for assent, the Speaker
endorses it as a money bill.
The Constitution lays down a special procedure for the passing of money
bills in the Parliament. A money bill can only be introduced in the Lok
Sabha and that too on the recommendation of the president. Every such bill
is considered to be a government bill and can be introduced only by a
minister.
After a money bill is passed by the Lok Sabha, it is transmitted to the
Rajya Sabha for its consideration. The Rajya Sabha has restricted powers
with regard to a money bill. It cannot reject or amend a money bill. It can
only make the recommendations. It must return the bill to the Lok Sabha
within 14 days, whether with or without recommendations. The Lok Sabha
can either accept or reject all or any of the recommendations of the Rajya
Sabha.
If the Lok Sabha accepts any recommendation, the bill is then deemed to
have been passed by both the Houses in the modified form. If the Lok
Sabha does not accept any recommendation, the bill is then deemed to have
passed by both the Houses in the form originally passed by the Lok Sabha
without any change.
If the Rajya Sabha does not return the bill to the Lok Sabha within 14
days, the bill is deemed to have been passed by both the Houses in the form
originally passed by the Lok Sabha. Thus, the Lok Sabha has more powers
than Rajya Sabha with regard to a money bill. On the other hand, both the
Houses have equal powers with regard to an ordinary bill.
Finally, when a money bill is presented to the president, he may either
give his assent to the bill or withhold his assent to the bill but cannot return
the bill for reconsideration of the Houses. Normally, the president gives his
assent to a money bill as it is introduced in the Parliament with his prior
permission.
Table 22.4 shows the differences between the procedures for the
enactment of ordinary bills and money bills.
Financial Bills
Financial bills are those bills that deal with fiscal matters, that is, revenue or
expenditure. However, the Constitution uses the term ‘financial bill’ in a
technical sense. Financial bills are of three kinds:
1.  Money bills–Article 110
2.  Financial bills (I)–Article 117 (1)
3.  Financial bills (II)–Article 117 (3)
This classification implies that money bills are simply a species of
financial bills. Hence, all money bills are financial bills but all financial
bills are not money bills. Only those financial bills are money bills which
contain exclusively those matters which are mentioned in Article 110 of the
Constitution. These are also certified by the Speaker of Lok Sabha as
money bills. The financial bills (I) and (II), on the other hand, have been
dealt with in Article 117 of the Constitution.

of the Speaker when transmitted to
the Rajya Sabha (if it has originated
in the Lok Sabha). 
6.  It requires the certification of
the Speaker when transmitted
to the Rajya Sabha. 
7.  It is sent for the President’s assent
only after being approved by both
the Houses. In case of a deadlock
due to disagreement between the
two Houses, a joint sitting of both
the houses can be summoned by the
president to resolve the deadlock. 
7.  It is sent for the President’s
assent even if it is approved by
only Lok Sabha. There is no
chance of any disagreement
between the two Houses and
hence, there is no provision of
joint sitting of both the Houses
in this regard. 
8.  Its defeat in the Lok Sabha may lead
to the resignation of the government
(if it is introduced by a minister). 
8.  Its defeat in the Lok Sabha
leads to the resignation of the
government. 
9.  It can be rejected, approved, or
returned for reconsideration by the
President. 
9.  It can be rejected or approved
but cannot be returned for
reconsideration by the
President. 
Financial Bills (I)
A financial bill (I) is a bill that contains not only any or all the matters
mentioned in Article 110, but also other matters of general legislation. For
instance, a bill that contains a borrowing clause, but does not exclusively
deal with borrowing. In two respects, a financial bill (I) is similar to a
money bill–(a) both of them can be introduced only in the Lok Sabha and
not in the Rajya Sabha, and (b) both of them can be introduced only on the
recommendation of the president. In all other respects, a financial bill (I) is
governed by the same legislative procedure applicable to an ordinary bill.
Hence, it can be either rejected or amended by the Rajya Sabha (except that
an amendment other than for reduction or abolition of a tax cannot be
moved in either House without the recommendation of the president i.e., the
recommendation of president is not required for moving an amendment
making provision for the reduction or aboli-sition of a tax). In case of a
disagreement between the two Houses over such a bill, the president can
summon a joint sitting of the two Houses to resolve the deadlock. When the
bill is presented to the President, he can either give his assent to the bill or
withhold his assent to the bill or return the bill for reconsideration of the
Houses.
Financial Bills (II)
A financial bill (II) contains provisions involving expenditure from the
Consolidated Fund of India, but does not include any of the matters
mentioned in Article 110. It is treated as an ordinary bill and in all respects,
it is governed by the same legislative procedure which is applicable to an
ordinary bill. The only special feature of this bill is that it cannot be passed
by either House of Parliament unless the President has recommended to that
House the consideration of the bill. Hence, financial bill (II) can be
introduced in either House of Parliament and recommendation of the
President is not necessary for its introduction. In other words, the
recommendation of the President is not required at the introduction stage
but is required at the consideration stage. It can be either rejected or
amended by either House of Parliament. In case of a disagreement between
the two Houses over such a bill, the President can summon a joint sitting of
the two Houses to resolve the deadlock. When the bill is presented to the
President, he can either give his assent to the bill or withhold his assent to
the bill or return the bill for reconsideration of the Houses.
JOINT SITTING OF TWO HOUSES
Joint sitting is an extraordinary machinery provided by the Constitution to
resolve a deadlock between the two Houses over the passage of a bill. A
deadlock is deemed to have taken place under any one of the following
three situations after a bill has been passed by one House and transmitted to
the other House:
1.  if the bill is rejected by the other House;
2.  if the Houses have finally disagreed as to the amendments to be
made in the bill; or
3.  if more than six months have elapsed from the date of the receipt of
the bill by the other House without the bill being passed by it.
In the above three situations, the president can summon both the Houses
to meet in a joint sitting for the purpose of deliberating and voting on the
bill. It must be noted here that the provision of joint sitting is applicable to
ordinary bills or financial bills only and not to money bills or Constitutional
amendment bills. In the case of a money bill, the Lok Sabha has overriding
powers, while a Constitutional amendment bill must be passed by each
House separately.
In reckoning the period of six months, no account can be taken of any
period during which the other House (to which the bill has been sent) is
prorogued or adjourned for more than four consecutive days.
If the bill (under dispute) has already lapsed due to the dissolution of the
Lok Sabha, no joint sitting can be summoned. But, the joint sitting can be
held if the Lok Sabha is dissolved after the President has notified his
intention to summon such a sitting (as the bill does not lapse in this case).
After the President notifies his intention to summon a joint sitting of the
two Houses, none of the Houses can proceed further with the bill.
The Speaker of Lok Sabha presides over a joint sitting of the two Houses
and the Deputy Speaker, in his absence. If the Deputy Speaker is also absent
from a joint sitting, the Deputy Chairman of Rajya Sabha presides. If he is
also absent, such other person as may be determined by the members
present at the joint sitting, presides over the meeting. It is clear that the
Chairman of Rajya Sabha does not preside over a joint sitting as he is not a
member of either House of Parliament.
The quorum to constitute a joint sitting is one-tenth of the total number of
members of the two Houses. The joint sitting is governed by the Rules of
Procedure of Lok Sabha and not of Rajya Sabha.
If the bill in dispute is passed by a majority of the total number of
members of both the Houses present and voting in the joint sitting, the bill
is deemed to have been passed by both the Houses. Normally, the Lok
Sabha with greater number wins the battle in a joint sitting.
The Constitution has specified that at a joint sitting, new amendments to
the bill cannot be proposed except in two cases:
1.  those amendments that have caused final disagreement between the
Houses; and
2.  those amendments that might have become necessary due to the
delay in the passage of the bill.
Since 1950, the provision regarding the joint sitting of the two Houses
has been invoked only thrice. The bills that have been passed at joint
sittings are:
1.  Dowry Prohibition Bill, 1960.20
2.  Banking Service Commission (Repeal)
Bill, 1977.21
3.  Prevention of Terrorism Bill, 2002.22
BUDGET IN PARLIAMENT
The Constitution refers to the budget as the ‘annual financial statement’. In
other words, the term ‘budget’ has nowhere been used in the Constitution. It
is the popular name for the ‘annual financial statement’ that has been dealt
with in Article 112 of the Constitution.
The budget is a statement of the estimated receipts and expenditure of the
Government of India in a financial year, which begins on 1 April and ends
on 31 March of the following year.
In addition to the estimates of receipts and expenditure, the budget
contains certain other elements. Overall, the budget contains the following:
1.  Estimates of revenue and capital receipts;
2.  Ways and means to raise the revenue;
3.  Estimates of expenditure;
4.  Details of the actual receipts and expenditure of the closing
financial year and the reasons for any deficit or surplus in that year;
and
5.  Economic and financial policy of the coming year, that is, taxation
proposals, prospects of revenue, spending programme and introduction
of new schemes/projects.
Till 2017, the Government of India had two budgets, namely, the Railway
Budget and the General Budget. While the former consisted of the estimates
of receipts and expenditures of only the Ministry of Railways, the latter
consisted of the estimates of receipts and expenditure of all the ministries of
the Government of India (except the railways).
The Railway Budget was separated from the General Budget in 1924 on
the recommendations of the Acworth Committee Report (1921). The
reasons or objectives of this separation were as follows:
1.  To introduce flexibility in railway finance.
2.  To facilitate a business approach to the railway policy.
3.  To secure stability of the general revenues by providing an assured
annual contribution from railway revenues.
4.  To enable the railways to keep their profits for their own
development (after paying a fixed annual contribution to the general
revenues).
In 2017, the Central Government merged the railway budget into the
general budget. Hence, there is now only one budget for the Government of
India i.e., Union Budget.
Constitutional Provisions
The Constitution of India contains the following provisions with regard to
the enactment of budget:
1.  The President shall in respect of every financial year cause to be
laid before both the Houses of Parliament a statement of estimated
receipts and expenditure of the Government of India for that year.
2.  No demand for a grant shall be made except on the
recommendation of the President.
3.  No money shall be withdrawn from the Consolidated Fund of India
except under appropriation made by law.
4.  No money bill imposing tax shall be introduced in the Parliament
except on the recommendation of the President, and such a bill shall
not be introduced in the Rajya Sabha.
5.  No tax shall be levied or collected except by authority of law.
6.  Parliament can reduce or abolish a tax but cannot increase it.
7.  The Constitution has also defined the relative roles or position of
both the Houses of Parliament with regard to the enactment of the
budget in the following way:
(a)  A money bill or finance bill dealing with taxation cannot be
introduced in the Rajya Sabha–it must be introduced only in the Lok
Sabha.
(b)  The Rajya Sabha has no power to vote on the demand for grants; it
is the exclusive privilege of the Lok Sabha.
(c)  The Rajya Sabha should return the Money bill (or Finance bill) to
the Lok Sabha within fourteen days. The Lok Sabha can either accept
or reject the recommendations made by Rajya Sabha in this regard.
8.  The estimates of expenditure embodied in the budget shall show
separately the expenditure charged on the Consolidated Fund of India
and the expenditure made from the Consolidated Fund of India.
9.  The budget shall distinguish expenditure on revenue account from
other expenditure.
10.  The expenditure charged on the Consolidated Fund of India shall
not be submitted to the vote of Parliament. However, it can be
discussed by the Parliament.
Charged Expenditure
The budget consists of two types of expen-diture–the expenditure ‘charged’
upon the Consolidated Fund of India and the expenditure ‘made’ from the
Consolidated Fund of India. The charged expenditure is non-votable by the
Parliament, that is, it can only be discussed by the Parliament, while the
other type has to be voted by the Parliament. The list of the charged
expenditure is as follows:
1.  Emoluments and allowances of the President and other expenditure
relating to his office.
2.  Salaries and allowances of the Chairman and the Deputy Chairman
of the Rajya Sabha and the Speaker and the Deputy Speaker of the Lok
Sabha.
3.  Salaries, allowances and pensions of the judges of the Supreme
Court.
4.  Pensions of the judges of high courts.
5.  Salary, allowances and pension of the Comptroller and Auditor
General of India.
6.  Salaries, allowances and pension of the chairman and members of
the Union Public Service Commission.
7.  Administrative expenses of the Supreme Court, the office of the
Comptroller and Auditor General of India and the Union Public
Service Commission including the salaries, allowances and pensions of
the persons serving in these offices.
8.  The debt charges for which the Government of India is liable,
including interest, sinking fund charges and redemption charges and
other expenditure relating to the raising of loans and the service and
redemption of debt.
9.  Any sum required to satisfy any judgement, decree or award of any
court or arbitral tribunal.
10.  Any other expenditure declared by the Parliament to be so
charged.
Stages in Enactment
The budget goes through the following six stages in the Parliament:
1.  Presentation of budget.
2.  General discussion.
3.  Scrutiny by departmental committees.
4.  Voting on demands for grants.
5.  Passing of appropriation bill.
6.  Passing of finance bill.
1. Presentation of Budget
Conventionally, the budget is presented to the Lok Sabha by the finance
minister on the last working day of February. Since 2017, the presentation
of the budget has been advanced to 1stof February.
The Budget can also be presented to the House in two or more parts and
when such presentation takes place, each part shall be dealt with as if it
were the budget. Further, there shall be no discussion of the budget on the
day on which it is presented to the House.
The finance minister presents the budget with a speech known as the
‘budget speech’. At the end of the speech in the Lok Sabha, the budget is
laid before the Rajya Sabha, which can only discuss it and has no power to
vote on the demands for grants.
The budget documents presented to the Parliament comprise of the
following :
(i) Budget Speech
(ii) Annual Financial Statement
(iii) Demands for Grants
(iv) Appropriation Bill
(v) Finance Bill
(vi) Statements mandated under the FRBM Act:
(a)  Macro-Economic Framework Statement
(b)  Fiscal Policy Strategy Statement
(c)  Medium Term Fiscal Policy Statement
(vii) Expenditure Budget
(viii) Receipts Budget
(ix) Expenditure Profile
(x) Memorandum Explaining the Provisions in the Finance Bill
(xi) Budget at a Glance
(xii) Outcome Budget
Earlier, the Economic Survey also used to be presented to the Parliament
along with the budget. Now, it is presented one day or a few days before the
presentation of the budget. This report is prepared by the finance ministry
and indicates the status of the national economy.
2. General Discussion
The general discussion on budget begins a few days after its presentation. It
takes place in both the Houses of Parliament and lasts usually for three to
four days.
During this stage, the Lok Sabha can discuss the budget as a whole or on
any question of principle involved therein but no cut motion can be moved
nor can the budget be submitted to the vote of the House. The finance
minister has a general right of reply at the end of the discussion.
3. Scrutiny by Departmental Committees
After the general discussion on the budget is over, the Houses are adjourned
for about three to four weeks. During this gap period, the 24 departmental
standing committees of Parliament examine and discuss in detail the
demands for grants of the concerned ministers and prepare reports on them.
These reports are submitted to both the Houses of Parliament for
consideration.
The standing committee system established in 1993 (and expanded in
2004) makes parliamentary financial control over ministries much more
detailed, close, in-depth and comprehensive.
4. Voting on Demands for Grants
In the light of the reports of the departmental standing committees, the Lok
Sabha takes up voting of demands for grants. The demands are presented
ministrywise. A demand becomes a grant after it has been duly voted.
Two points should be noted in this context. One, the voting of demands
for grants is the exclusive privilege of the Lok Sabha, that is, the Rajya
Sabha has no power of voting the demands. Second, the voting is confined
to the votable part of the budget–the expenditure charged on the
Consolidated Fund of India is not submitted to the vote (it can only be
discussed).
Each demand is voted separately by the Lok Sabha. During this stage, the
members of Parliament can discuss the details of the budget. They can also
move motions to reduce any demand for grant. Such motions are called as
‘cut motion’, which are of three kinds:
(a) Policy Cut Motion
It represents the disapproval of the policy underlying the demand. It states
that the amount of the demand be reduced to Re 1. The members can also
advocate an alternative policy.
(b) Economy Cut Motion
It represents the economy that can be affected in the proposed expenditure.
It states that the amount of the demand be reduced by a specified amount
(which may be either a lumpsum reduction in the demand or ommission or
reduction of an item in the demand).
(c) Token Cut Motion
It ventilates a specific grievance that is within the sphere of responsibility
of the Government of India. It states that the amount of the demand be
reduced by ₹100.
A cut motion, to be admissible, must satisfy the following conditions:
(i) It should relate to one demand only.
(ii) It should be clearly expressed and should not contain arguments
or defamatory statements.
(iii) It should be confined to one specific matter.
(iv) It should not make suggestions for the amendment or repeal of
existing laws.
(v) It should not refer to a matter that is not primarily the concern of
Union government.
(vi) It should not relate to the expenditure charged on the
Consolidated Fund of India.
(vii) It should not relate to a matter that is under adjudication by a
court.
(viii) It should not raise a question of privilege.
(ix) It should not revive discussion on a matter on which a decision
has been taken in the same session.
(x) It should not relate to a trivial matter.
(xi) It should not reflect on the character or conduct of any person
whose conduct can only be challenged on a substantive motion.
(xii) It should not anticipate a matter which has been previously
appointed for consideration in the same session.
(xiii) It should not seek to raise a discussion on a matter pending
before any statutory tribunal or statutory authority performing
judicial or quasi-judicial functions or any commission or court
of enquiry.
The significance of a cut motion lies in: (a) facilitating the initiation of
concentrated discussion on a specific demand for grant; and (b) upholding
the principle of responsible government by probing the activities of the
government. However, the cut motion do not have much utility in practice.
They are only moved and discussed in the House but not passed as the
government enjoys majority support. Their passage by the Lok Sabha
amounts to the expressions of want of parliamentary confidence in the
government and may lead to its resignation.
On the last day of the days allotted for discussion and voting on the
demands for grants, the Speaker puts all the remaining demands to vote and
disposes them whether they have been discussed by the members or not.
This is known as ‘guillotine’.
5. Passing of Appropriation Bill
The Constitution states that ‘no money shall be withdrawn from the
Consolidated Fund of India except under appropriation made by law’.
Accordingly, an appropriation bill is introduced to provide for the
appropriation, out of the Consolidated Fund of India, all money required to
meet:
(a)  The grants voted by the Lok Sabha.
(b)  The expenditure charged on the Consolidated Fund of India.
No such amendment can be proposed to the appropriation bill in either
house of the Parliament that will have the effect of varying the amount or
altering the destination of any grant voted, or of varying the amount of any
expenditure charged on the Consolidated Fund of India.
The Appropriation Bill becomes the Appropriation Act after it is assented
to by the President. This act authorises (or legalises) the payments from the
Consolidated Fund of India. This means that the government cannot
withdraw money from the Consolidated Fund of India till the enactment of
the appropriation bill. This takes time and usually goes on till the end of
April. But the government needs money to carry on its normal activities
after 31 March (the end of the financial year). To overcome this functional
difficulty, the Constitution has authorised the Lok Sabha to make any grant
in advance in respect to the estimated expenditure for a part of the financial
year, pending the completion of the voting of the demands for grants and
the enactment of the appropriation bill. This provision is known as the ‘vote
on account’. It is passed (or granted) after the general discussion on budget
is over. It is generally granted for two months for an amount equivalent to
one-sixth of the total estimation.
6. Passing of Finance Bill
The Finance Bill is introduced to give effect to the financial proposals of
the Government of India for the following year. It is subjected to all the
conditions applicable to a Money Bill. Unlike the Appropriation Bill, the
amendments (seeking to reject or reduce a tax) can be moved in the case of
finance bill.
According to the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act of 1931, the
Finance Bill must be enacted (i.e., passed by the Parliament and assented to
by the president) within 75 days.
The Finance Act legalises the income side of the budget and completes
the process of the enactment of the budget.
Other Grants
In addition to the budget that contains the ordinary estimates of income and
expenditure for one financial year, various other grants are made by the
Parliament under extraordinary or special circumstances:
Supplementary Grant
It is granted when the amount authorised by the Parliament through the
appropriation act for a particular service for the current financial year is
found to be insufficient for that year.
Additional Grant
It is granted when a need has arisen during the current financial year for
additional expenditure upon some new service not contemplated in the
budget for that year.
Excess Grant
It is granted when money has been spent on any service during a financial
year in excess of the amount granted for that service in the budget for that
year. It is voted by the Lok Sabha after the financial year. Before the
demands for excess grants are submitted to the Lok Sabha for voting, they
must be approved by the Public Accounts Committee of Parliament.
Vote of Credit
It is granted for meeting an unexpected demand upon the resources of India,
when on account of the magnitude or the indefinite character of the service,
the demand cannot be stated with the details ordinarily given in a budget.
Hence, it is like a blank cheque given to the Executive by the Lok Sabha.
Exceptional Grant
It is granted for a special purpose and forms no part of the current service of
any financial year.
Token Grant
It is granted when funds to meet the proposed expenditure on a new service
can be made available by reappropriation. A demand for the grant of a
token sum (of Re 1) is submitted to the vote of the Lok Sabha and if
assented, funds are made available. Reappropriation involves transfer of
funds from one head to another. It does not involve any additional
expenditure.
Supplementary, additional, excess and exceptional grants and vote of
credit are regulated by the same procedure which is applicable in the case of
a regular budget.
Funds
The Constitution of India provides for the following three kinds of funds for
the Central government:
1.  Consolidated Fund of India (Article 266)
2.  Public Account of India (Article 266)
3.  Contingency Fund of India (Article 267)
Consolidated Fund of India
It is a fund to which all receipts are credited and all payments are debited.
In other words, (a) all revenues received by the Government of India; (b) all
loans raised by the Government by the issue of treasury bills, loans or ways
and means of advances; and (c) all money received by the government in
repayment of loans forms the Consolidated Fund of India. All the legally
authorised payments on behalf of the Government of India are made out of
this fund. No money out of this fund can be appropriated (issued or drawn)
except in accordance with a parliamentary law.
Public Account of India
All other public money (other than those which are credited to the
Consolidated Fund of India) received by or on behalf of the Government of
India shall be credited to the Public Account of India. This includes
provident fund deposits, judicial deposits, savings bank deposits,
departmental deposits, remittances and so on. This account is operated by
executive action, that is, the payments from this account can by made
without parliamentary appropriation. Such payments are mostly in the
nature of banking transactions.
Contingency Fund of India
The Constitution authorised the Parliament to establish a ‘Contingency
Fund of India’, into which amounts determined by law are paid from time
to time. Accordingly, the Parliament enacted the contingency fund of India
Act in 1950. This fund is placed at the disposal of the president, and he can
make advances out of it to meet unforeseen expenditure pending its
authorisation by the Parliament. The fund is held by the finance secretary
on behalf of the president. Like the public account of India, it is also
operated by executive action.
MULTIFUNCTIONAL ROLE OF PARLIAMENT
In the ‘Indian politico-administrative system’, the Parliament occupies a
central position and has a multifunctional role. It enjoys extensive powers
and performs a variety of functions towards the fulfilment of its
constitutionally expected role. Its powers and functions can be classified
under the following heads:
1.  Legislative Powers and Functions
2.  Executive Powers and Functions
3.  Financial Powers and Functions
4.  Constituent Powers and Functions
5.  Judicial Powers and Functions
6.  Electoral Powers and Functions
7.  Other powers and functions.
1. Legislative Powers and Functions
The primary function of Parliament is to make laws for the governance of
the country. It has exclusive power to make laws on the subjects
enumerated in the Union List (which at present has 98 subjects, originally
97 subjects) and on the residuary subjects (that is, subjects not enumerated
in any of the three lists). With regard to Concurrent List (which has at
present 52 subjects, originally 47 subjects), the Parliament has overriding
powers, that is, the law of Parliament prevails over the law of the state
legislature in case of a conflict between the two.
The Constitution also empowers the Parliament to make laws on the
subjects enumerated in the State List (which at present has 59 subjects,
originally 66 subjects) under the following five abnormal circumstances:
(a)  when Rajya Sabha passes a resolution to that effect.
(b)  when a proclamation of National Emergency is in operation.
(c)  when two or more states make a joint request to the Parliament.
(d)  when necessary to give effect to international agreements, treaties
and conventions.
(e)  when President’s Rule is in operation in the state.
All the ordinances issued by the president (during the recess of the
Parliament) must be approved by the Parliament within six weeks after its
reassembly. An ordinance becomes inoperative if it is not approved by the
parliament within that period.
The Parliament makes laws in a skeleton form and authorises the
Executive to make detailed rules and regulations within the framework of
the parent law. This is known as delegated legislation or executive
legislation or subordinate legislation. Such rules and regulations are placed
before the Parliament for its examination.
2. Executive Powers and Functions
The Constitution of India established a parliamentary form of government
in which the Executive is responsible to the Parliament for its policies and
acts. Hence, the Parliament exercises control over the Executive through
question-hour, zero hour, half-an-hour discussion, short duration discussion,
calling attention motion, adjournment motion, no-confidence motion,
censure motion and other discussions. It also supervises the activities of the
Executive with the help of its committees like committee on government
assurance, committee on subordinate legislation, committee on petitions,
etc.
The ministers are collectively responsible to the Parliament in general
and to the Lok Sabha in particular. As a part of collective responsibility,
there is individual responsibility, that is, each minister is individually
responsible for the efficient administration of the ministry under his charge.
This means that they continue in office so long as they enjoy the confidence
of the majority members in the Lok Sabha. In other words, the council of
ministers can be removed from office by the Lok Sabha by passing a
noconfidence motion. The Lok Sabha can also express lack of confidence in
the government in the following ways:
(a)  By not passing a motion of thanks on the President’s inaugural
address.
(b)  By rejecting a money bill.
(c)  By passing a censure motion or an adjournment motion.
(d)  By defeating the government on a vital issue.
(e)  By passing a cut motion.
Therefore, “the first function of Parliament can be said to be to select the
group which is to form the government, support and sustain it in power so
long as it enjoys its confidence, and to expel it when it ceases to do so, and
leave it to the people to decide at the next general election.”23
3. Financial Powers and Functions
No tax can be levied or collected and no expenditure can be incurred by the
Executive except under the authority and with the approval of Parliament.
Hence, the budget is placed before the Parliament for its approval. The
enactment of the budget by the Parliament legalises the receipts and
expenditure of the government for the ensuing financial year.
The Parliament also scrutinises government spending and financial
performance with the help of its financial committees. These include public
accounts committee, estimates committee and committee on public
undertakings. They bring out the cases of illegal, irregular, unauthorised,
improper usage and wastage and extravagance in public expenditure.
Therefore, the parliamentary control over the Executive in financial
matters operates in two stages:
(a)  budgetary control, that is, control before the appropriation of
grants through the enactment of the budget; and
(b)  post-budgetary control, that is, control after the appropriation of
grants through the three financial committees.
The budget is based on the principle of annuity, that is, the Parliament
grants money to the government for one financial year. If the granted
money is not spent by the end of the financial year, then the balance expires
and returns to the Consolidated Fund of India. This practice is known as the
‘rule of lapse’. It facilitates effective financial control by the Parliament as
no reserve funds can be built without its authorisation. However, the
observance of this rule leads to heavy rush of expenditure towards the close
of the financial year. This is popularly called as ‘March Rush’.
4. Constituent Powers and Functions
The Parliament is vested with the powers to amend the Constitution by way
of addition, variation or repeal of any provision. The major part of the
Constitution can be amended by the Parliament with special majority, that
is, a majority of the total membership of each House and a majority of not
less than two-thirds of the members present and voting in each House.
Some other provisions of the Constitution can be amended by the
Parliament with simple majority, that is, a majority of the members present
and voting in each House of Parliament. Only a few provisions of the
Constitution can be amended by the Parliament (by special majority) and
with the consent of at least half of the state Legislatures (by simple
majority). However, the power to initiate the process of the amendment of
the Constitution (in all the three cases) lies exclusively in the hands of the
Parliament and not the state legislature. There is only one exception, that is,
the state legislature can pass a resolution requesting the Parliament for the
creation or abolition of the legislative council in the state. Based on the
resolution, the Parliament makes an act for amending the Constitution to
that effect. To sum up, the Parliament can amend the Constitution in three
ways:
(a)  By simple majority;
(b)  By special majority; and
(c)  By special majority but with the consent of half of all the state
legislatures.
The constituent power of the Parliament is not unlimited; it is subject to
the ‘basic structure’ of the Constitution. In others words, the Parliament can
amend any provision of the Constitution except the ‘basic features’ of the
Constitution. This was ruled by the Supreme Court in the Kesavananda
Bharati case (1973) and reaffirmed in the Minerva Mills case (1980)24
 .
5. Judicial Powers and Functions
The judicial powers and functions of the Parliament include the following:
(a)  It can impeach the President for the violation of the Constitution.
(b)  It can remove the Vice-President from his office.
(c)  It can recommend the removal of judges (including chief justice)
of the Supreme Court and the high courts, chief election commissioner,
comptroller and auditor general to the president.
(d)  It can punish its members or outsiders for the breach of its
privileges or its contempt.
6. Electoral Powers and Functions
The Parliament participates in the election of the President (along with the
state legislative assemblies) and elects the Vice-President. The Lok Sabha
elects its Speaker and Deputy Speaker, while the Rajya Sabha elects its
Deputy Chairman.
The Parliament is also authorised to make laws to regulate the elections
to the offices of President and Vice-President, to both the Houses of
Parliament and to both the Houses of state legislature. Accordingly,
Parliament enacted the Presidential and Vice-Presidential Election Act
(1952), the Representation of People Act (1950), the Representation of
People Act (1951), etc.
7. Other Powers and Functions
The various other powers and functions of the Parliament include:
(a)  It serves as the highest deliberative body in the country. It
discusses various issues of national and international significance.
(b)  It approves all the three types of emergencies (national, state and
financial) proclaimed by the President.
(c)  It can create or abolish the state legislative councils on the
recommendation of the concerned state legislative assemblies.
(d)  It can increase or decrease the area, alter the boundaries and
change the names of states of the Indian Union.
(e)  It can regulate the organisation and jurisdiction of the Supreme
Court and high courts and can establish a common high court for two
or more states.
INEFFECTIVENESS OF PARLIAMENTARY CONTROL
The parliamentary control over government and administration in India is
more theoretical than practical. In reality, the control is not as effective as it
ought to be. The following factors are responsible for this:
(a)  The Parliament has neither time nor expertise to control the
administration which has grown in volume as well as complexity.
(b)  Parliament’s financial control is hindered by the technical nature
of the demands for grants. The parliamentarians being laymen cannot
understand them properly and fully.
(c)  The legislative leadership lies with the Executive and it plays a
significant role in formulating policies.
(d)  The very size of the Parliament is too large and unmanagable to be
effective.
(e)  The majority support enjoyed by the Executive in the Parliament
reduces the possibility of effective criticism.
(f)  The financial committees like Public Accounts Committee
examines the public expenditure after it has been incurred by the
Executive. Thus, they do post mortem work.
(g)  The increased recourse to ‘guillotine’ reduced the scope of
financial control.
(h)  The growth of ‘delegated legislation’ has reduced the role of
Parliament in making detailed laws and has increased the powers of
bureaucracy.
(i)  The frequent promulgation of ordinances by the president dilutes
the Parliament’s power of legislation.
(j)  The Parliament’s control is sporadic, general and mostly political
in nature.
(k)  Lack of strong and steady opposition in the Parliament, and a
setback in the parliamentary behaviour and ethics, have also
contributed to the ineffectiveness of legislative control over
administration in India.
POSITION OF RAJYA SABHA
The Constitutional position of the Rajya Sabha (as compared with the Lok
Sabha) can be studied from three angles:
1.  Where Rajya Sabha is equal to Lok Sabha.
2.  Where Rajya Sabha is unequal to Lok Sabha.
3.  Where Rajya Sabha has special powers that are not at all shared
with the Lok Sabha.
Equal Status with Lok Sabha
In the following matters, the powers and status of the Rajya Sabha are equal
to that of the Lok Sabha:
1.  Introduction and passage of ordinary bills.
2.  Introduction and passage of Constitutional amendment bills.
3.  Introduction and passage of financial bills involving expenditure
from the Consolidated Fund of India.
4.  Election and impeachment of the president.
5.  Election and removal of the Vice-President. However, Rajya Sabha
alone can initiate the removal of the vice-president. He is removed by
a resolution passed by the Rajya Sabha by an effective majority (which
is a type of special majority) and agreed to by the Lok Sabha by a
simple majority.
6.  Making recommendation to the President for the removal of Chief
Justice and judges of Supreme Court and high courts, chief election
commissioner and comptroller and auditor general.
7.  Approval of ordinances issued by the President.
8.  Approval of proclamation of all three types of emergencies by the
President.
9.  Selection of ministers including the Prime Minister. Under the
Constitution, the ministers including the Prime Minister can be
members of either House. However, irrespective of their membership,
they are responsible only to the Lok Sabha.
10.  Consideration of the reports of the constitutional bodies like
Finance Commission, Union Public Service Commission, comptroller
and auditor general, etc.
11.  Enlargement of the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and the
Union Public Service Commission.
Unequal Status with Lok Sabha
In the following matters, the powers and status of the Rajya Sabha are
unequal to that of the Lok Sabha:
1.  A Money Bill can be introduced only in the Lok Sabha and not in
the Rajya Sabha.
2.  Rajya Sabha cannot amend or reject a Money Bill. It should return
the bill to the Lok Sabha within 14 days, either with recommendations
or without recommendations.
3.  The Lok Sabha can either accept or reject all or any of the
recommendations of the Rajya Sabha. In both the cases, the money bill
is deemed to have been passed by the two Houses.
4.  A financial bill, not containing solely the matters of Article 110,
also can be introduced only in the Lok Sabha and not in the Rajya
Sabha. But, with regard to its passage, both the Houses have equal
powers.
5.  The final power to decide whether a particular bill is a Money Bill
or not is vested in the Speaker of the Lok Sabha.
6.  The Speaker of Lok Sabha presides over the joint sitting of both the
Houses.
7.  The Lok Sabha with greater number wins the battle in a joint sitting
except when the combined strength of the ruling party in both the
Houses is less than that of the opposition parties.
8.  Rajya Sabha can only discuss the budget but cannot vote on the
demands for grants (which is the exclusive privilege of the Lok
Sabha).
9.  A resolution for the discontinuance of the national emergency can
be passed only by the Lok Sabha and not by the Rajya Sabha.
10.  The Rajya Sabha cannot remove the council of ministers by
passing a no-confidence motion. This is because the Council of
ministers is collectively responsible only to the Lok Sabha. But, the
Rajya Sabha can discuss and criticise the policies and activities of the
government.
Special Powers of Rajya Sabha
The Rajya Sabha has been given four exclusive or special powers that are
not enjoyed by the Lok Sabha:
1.  It can authorise the Parliament to make a law on a subject
enumerated in the State List (Article 249).
2.  It can authorise the Parliament to create new All-India Services
common to both the Centre and states (Article 312).
3.  It alone can initiate a move for the removal of the vice-president. In
other words, a resolution for the removal of the vice-president can be
introduced only in the Rajya Sabha and not in the Lok Sabha (Article
67).
4.  If a proclamation is issued by the President for imposing national
emergency or president’s rule or financial emergency at a time when
the Lok Sabha has been dissolved or the dissolution of the Lok Sabha
takes place within the period allowed for its approval, then the
proclamation can remain effective even if it is approved by the Rajya
Sabha alone (Articles 352, 356 and 360).
An analysis of the above points makes it clear that the position of the
Rajya Sabha in our constitutional system is not as weak as that of the House
of Lords in the British constitutional system nor as strong as that of the
Senate in the American constitutional system. Except in financial matters
and control over the council of ministers, the powers and status of the Rajya
Sabha in all other spheres are broadly equal and coordinate with that of the
Lok Sabha.
Even though the Rajya Sabha has been given less powers as compared
with the Lok Sabha, its utility is supported on the following grounds:
1.  It checks hasty, defective, careless and ill-considered legislation
made by the Lok Sabha by making provision of revision and thought.
2.  It facilitates giving representation to eminent professionals and
experts who cannot face the direct election. The President nominates
12 such persons to the Rajya Sabha.
3.  It maintains the federal equilibrium by protecting the interests of
the states against the undue interference of the Centre.
PARLIAMENTARY PRIVILEGES
Meaning
Parliamentary privileges are special rights, immunities and exemptions
enjoyed by the two Houses of Parliament, their committees and their
members. They are necessary in order to secure the independence and
effectiveness of their actions. Without these privileges, the Houses can
neither maintain their authority, dignity and honour nor can protect their
members from any obstruction in the discharge of their parliamentary
responsibilities.
The Constitution has also extended the parliamentary privileges to those
persons who are entitled to speak and take part in the proceedings of a
House of Parliament or any of its committees. These include the attorney
general of India and Union ministers.
It must be clarified here that the parliamentary privileges do not extend to
the president who is also an integral part of the Parliament.
Classification
Parliamentary privileges can be classified into two broad categories:
1.  those that are enjoyed by each House of Parliament collectively,
and
2.  those that are enjoyed by the members individually.
Collective Privileges
The privileges belonging to each House of Parliament collectively are:
1.  It has the right to publish its reports, debates and proceedings and
also the right to prohibit others from publishing the same. The 44th
Amendment Act of 1978 restored the freedom of the press to publish
true reports of parliamentary proceedings without prior permission of
the House. But this is not applicable in the case of a secret sitting of
the House.
2.  It can exclude strangers from its proceedings and hold secret
sittings to discuss some important matters.
3.  It can make rules to regulate its own procedure and the conduct of
its business and to adjudicate upon such matters.
4.  It can punish members as well as outsiders for breach of its
privileges or its contempt by reprimand, admonition or imprisonment
(also suspension or expulsion, in case of members).25
5.  It has the right to receive immediate information of the arrest,
detention, conviction, imprisonment and release of a member.
6.  It can institute inquiries and order the attendance of witnesses and
send for relevant papers and records.
7.  The courts are prohibited to inquire into the proceedings of a House
or its committees.
8.  No person (either a member or outsider) can be arrested, and no
legal process (civil or criminal) can be served within the precincts of
the House without the permission of the presiding officer.
Individual Privileges
The privileges belonging to the members individually are:
1.  They cannot be arrested during the session of Parliament and 40
days before the beginning and 40 days after the end of a session. This
privilege is available only in civil cases and not in criminal cases or
preventive detention cases.
2.  They have freedom of speech in Parliament. No member is liable to
any proceedings in any court for anything said or any vote given by
him in Parliament or its committees. This freedom is subject to the
provisions of the Constitution and to the rules and standing orders
regulating the procedure of Parliament.26
3.  They are exempted from jury service. They can refuse to give
evidence and appear as a witness in a case pending in a court when
Parliament is in session.
Breach of Privilege and Contempt of the House
“When any individual or authority disregards or attacks any of the
privileges, rights and immunities, either of the member individually or
of the House in its collective capacity, the offence is termed as breach
of privilege and is punishable by the House.”27
Any act or omission which obstructs a House of Parliament, its member
or its officer in the performance of their functions or which has a tendency,
directly or indirectly to produce results against the dignity, authority and
honour of the House is treated as a contempt of the House.28
Though the two phrases, ‘breach of privilege’ and ‘contempt of the
House’ are used interchangeably, they have different implications.
‘Normally, a breach of privilege may amount to contempt of the House.
Likewise, contempt of the House may include a breach of privilege also.
Contempt of the House, however, has wider implications. There may be a
contempt of the House without specifically committing a breach of
privilege’.29 Similarly, ‘actions which are not breaches of any specific
privilege but are offences against the dignity and authority of the House
amount to contempt of the House’.30 For example, disobedience to a
legitimate order of the House is not a breach of privilege, but can be
punished as contempt of the House.
Sources of Privileges
Originally, the Constitution (Article 105) expressedly mentioned two
privileges, that is, freedom of speech in Parliament and right of publication
of its proceedings. With regard to other privileges, it provided that they
were to be the same as those of the British House of Commons, its
committees and its members on the date of its commencement (ie, 26
January, 1950), until defined by Parliament. The 44th Amendment Act of
1978 provided that the other privileges of each House of Parliament, its
committees and its members are to be those which they had on the date of
its commencement (ie, 20 June, 1979), until defined by Parliament. This
means that the position with regard to other privileges remains same. In
other words, the amendment has made only verbal changes by dropping a
direct reference to the British House of Commons, without making any
change in the implication of the provision.31
It should be noted here that the Parliament, till now, has not made any
special law to exhaustively codify all the privileges. They are based on five
sources, namely,
1.  Constitutional provisions,
2.  Various laws made by Parliament,
3.  Rules of both the Houses,
4.  Parliamentary conventions, and
5.  Judicial interpretations.
SOVEREIGNTY OF PARLIAMENT
The doctrine of ‘sovereignty of Parliament’ is associated with the British
Parliament. Sovereignty means the supreme power within the State. That
supreme power in Great Britain lies with the Parliament. There are no
‘legal’ restrictions on its authority and jurisdiction.
Therefore, the sovereignty of Parliament (parliamentary supremacy) is a
cardinal feature of the British constitutional system. According to AV
Dicey, the British jurist, this principle has three implications:32
1.  The Parliament can make, amend, substitute or repeal any law. De
Lolme, a British political analyst, said, ‘The British Parliament can do
every thing except make a woman a man and a man a woman’.
2.  The Parliament can make constitutional laws by the same procedure
as ordinary laws. In other words, there is no legal distinction between
the constituent authority and the legislative authority of the British
Parliament.
3.  The Parliamentary laws cannot be declared invalid by the Judiciary
as being unconstitutional. In other words, there is no system of judicial
review in Britain.
The Indian Parliament, on the other hand, cannot be regarded as a
sovereign body in the similar sense as there are ‘legal’ restrictions on its
authority and jurisdiction. The factors that limit the sovereignty of Indian
Parliament are:
1. Written Nature of the Constitution
The Constitution is the fundamental law of the land in our country. It has
defined the authority and jurisdiction of all the three organs of the Union
government and the nature of interrelationship between them. Hence, the
Parliament has to operate within the limits prescribed by the Constitution.
There is also a legal distinction between the legislative authority and the
constituent authority of the Parliament. Moreover, to effect certain
amendments to the Constitution, the ratification of half of the states is also
required. In Britain, on the other hand, the Constitution is neither written
nor there is anything like a fundamental law of the land.
2. Federal System of Government
India has a federal system of government with a constitutional division of
powers between the Union and the states. Both have to operate within the
spheres allotted to them. Hence, the law-making authority of the Parliament
gets confined to the subjects enumerated in the Union List and Concurrent
List and does not extend to the subjects enumerated in the State List (except
in five abnormal circumstances and that too for a short period). Britain, on
the other hand, has a unitary system of government and hence, all the
powers are vested in the Centre.
3. System of Judicial Review
The adoption of an independent Judiciary with the power of judicial review
also restricts the supremacy of our Parliament. Both the Supreme Court and
high courts can declare the laws enacted by the Parliament as void and ultra
vires (unconstitutional), if they contravene any provision of the
Constitution. On the other hand, there is no system of judicial review in
Britain. The British Courts have to apply the Parliamentary laws to specific
cases, without examining their constitutionality, legality or reasonableness.
4. Fundamental Rights
The authority of the Parliament is also restricted by the incorporation of a
code of justiciable fundamental rights under Part III of the Constitution.
Article 13 prohibits the State from making a law that either takes away
totally or abrogates in part a fundamental right. Hence, a Parliamentary law
that contravenes the fundamental rights shall be void. In Britain, on the
other hand, there is no codification of justiciable fundamental rights in the
Constitution. The British Parliament has also not made any law that lays
down the fundamental rights of the citizens. However, it does not mean that
the British citizens do not have rights. Though there is no charter
guaranteeing rights, there is maximum liberty in Britain due to the existence
of the Rule of Law.
Therefore, even though the nomenclature and organisational pattern of
our Parliament is similar to that of the British Parliament, there is a
substantial difference between the two. The Indian Parliament is not a
sovereign body in the sense in which the British Parliament is a sovereign
body. Unlike the British Parliament, the authority and jurisdiction of the
Indian Parliament are defined, limited and restrained.
In this regard, the Indian Parliament is similar to the American
Legislature (known as Congress). In USA also, the sovereignty of Congress
is legally restricted by the written character of the Constitution, the federal
system of government, the system of judicial review and the Bill of Rights.

23 Parliamentary Committees
MEANING
The Parliament is too unwieldy a body to deliberate effectively the issues
that come up before it. The functions of the Parliament are varied, complex
and voluminous. Moreover, it has neither the adequate time nor necessary
expertise to make a detailed scrutiny of all legislative measures and other
matters. Therefore, it is assisted by a number of committees in the discharge
of its duties.
The Constitution of India makes a mention of these committees at
different places, but without making any specific provisions regarding their
composition, tenure, functions, etc. All these matters are dealt by the rules
of two Houses. Accordingly, a parliamentary committee means a committee
that:
1.  Is appointed or elected by the House or nominated by the Speaker /
Chairman1
2.  Works under the direction of the Speaker / Chairman
3.  Presents its report to the House or to the Speaker / Chairman
4.  Has a secretariat provided by the Lok Sabha / Rajya Sabha
The consultative committees, which also consist of members of
Parliament, are not parliamentary committees as they do not fulfill above
four conditions.2
CLASSIFICATION
Broadly, parliamentary committees are of two kinds–Standing Committees
and Ad Hoc Committees. The former are permanent (constituted every year
or periodically) and work on a continuous basis, while the latter are
temporary and cease to exist on completion of the task assigned to them.
Standing Committees
On the basis of the nature of functions performed by them, standing
committees can be classified into the following six categories:
1. Financial Committees
(a)  Public Accounts Committee
(b)  Estimates Committee
(c)  Committee on Public Undertakings
2. Departmental Standing Committees (24)
3. Committees to Inquire
(a)  Committee on Petitions
(b)  Committee of Privileges
(c)  Ethics Committee
4. Committees to Scrutinise and Control
(a)  Committee on Government Assurances
(b)  Committee on Subordinate Legislation
(c)  Committee on Papers Laid on the Table
(d)  Committee on Welfare of SCs and STs
(e)  Committee on Empowerment of Women
(f)  Joint Committee3
 on Offices of Profit
5. Committees Relating to the Day-to-Day Business of the House
(a)  Business Advisory Committee
(b)  Committee on Private Members’ Bills and Resolutions
(c)  Rules Committee
(d)  Committee on Absence of Members from Sittings of the House
6. House-Keeping Committees or Service Committees (i.e., Committees
concerned with the Provision of Facilities and Services to Members):
(a)  General Purposes Committee
(b)  House Committee
(c)  Library Committee
(d)  Joint Committee on Salaries and Allowances of Members
Ad Hoc Committees
Ad hoc committees can be divided into two categories, that is, Inquiry
Committees and Advisory Committees.
1.  Inquiry Committees are constituted from time to time, either by the
two Houses on a motion adopted in that behalf, or by the Speaker /
Chairman, to inquire into and report on specific subjects. For example:
(a)  Committee on the Conduct of Certain Members during President’s
Address
(b)  Committee on Draft Five-Year Plan
(c)  Railway Convention Committee4
(d)  Committee on Members of Parliament Local Area Development
Scheme (MPLADS)
(e)  Joint Committee on Bofors Contract
(f)  Joint Committee on Fertilizer Pricing
(g)  Joint Committee to Enquire into Irregularities in Securities and
Banking Transactions
(h)  Joint Committee on Stock Market Scam
(i)  Joint Committee on Security in Parliament Complex
(j)  Committee on Provision of Computers to Members of Parliament,
Offices of Political Parties and Officers of the Lok Sabha Secretariat
(k)  Committee on Food Management in Parliament House Complex
(l)  Committee on Installation of Portraits / Statues of National Leaders
and Parliamentarians in Parliament House Complex
(m)  Joint Committee on Maintenance of Heritage Character and
Development of Parliament House Complex
(n)  Committee on Violation of Protocol Norms and Contemptuous
Behaviour of Government Officers with Members of Lok Sabha
(o)  Joint Committee to Examine Matters Relating to Allocation and
Pricing of Telecom Licences and Spectrum
2.  Advisory Committees include select or joint committees on bills,
which are appointed to consider and report on particular bills. These
committees are distinguishable from the other ad hoc committees in as
much as they are concerned with bills and the procedure to be
followed by them is laid down in the Rules of Procedure and the
Directions by the Speaker / Chairman.
When a Bill comes up before a House for general discussion, it is open to
that House to refer it to a Select Committee of the House or a Joint
Committee of the two Houses. A motion to this effect has to be moved and
adopted in the House in which the Bill comes up for consideration. In case
the motion adopted is for reference of the Bill to a Joint Committee, the
decision is conveyed to the other House, requesting the members to
nominate members of the other House to serve on the Committee.
The Select or Joint Committee considers the Bill clause by clause just as
the two Houses do. Amendments to various clauses can be moved by
members of the Committee. The Committee can also take evidence of
associations, public bodies or experts who are interested in the Bill. After
the Bill has thus been considered, the Committee submits its report to the
House. Members who do not agree with the majority report may append
their minutes of dissent to the report.
FINANCIAL COMMITTEES
Public Accounts Committee
This committee was set up first in 1921 under the provisions of the
Government of India Act of 1919 and has since been in existence. At
present, it consists of 22 members (15 from the Lok Sabha and 7 from the
Rajya Sabha). The members are elected by the Parliament every year from
amongst its members according to the principle of proportional
representation by means of the single transferable vote. Thus, all parties get
due representation in it. The term of office of the members is one year. A
minister cannot be elected as a member of the committee. The chairman of
the committee is appointed from amongst its members by the Speaker. Until
1966 - ‘67, the chairman of the committee belonged to the ruling party.
However, since 1967 a convention has developed whereby the chairman of
the committee is selected invariably from the Opposition.
The function of the committee is to examine the annual audit reports of
the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG), which are laid before
the Parliament by the President. The CAG submits three audit reports to the
President, namely, audit report on appropriation accounts, audit report on
finance accounts and audit report on public undertakings.
The committee examines public expenditure not only from legal and
formal point of view to discover technical irregularities but also from the
point of view of economy, prudence, wisdom and propriety to bring out the
cases of waste, loss, corruption, extravagance, inefficiency and nugatory
expenses.
In more detail, the functions of the committee are:
1.  To examine the appropriation accounts and the finance accounts of
the Union government and any other accounts laid before the Lok
Sabha. The appropriation accounts compare the actual expenditure
with the expenditure sanctioned by the Parliament through the
Appropriation Act, while the finance accounts shows the annual
receipts and disbursements of the Union Government.
2.  In scrutinising the appropriation accounts and the audit report of
CAG on it, the committee has to satisfy itself that
(a)  The money that has been disbursed was legally available for the
applied service or purpose
(b)  The expenditure conforms to the authority that governs it
(c)  Every re-appropriation has been made in accordance with the
related rules
3.  To examine the accounts of state corporations, trading concerns and
manufacturing projects and the audit report of CAG on them (except
those public undertakings which are allotted to the Committee on
Public Undertakings)
4.  To examine the accounts of autonomous and semi-autonomous
bodies, the audit of which is conducted by the CAG
5.  To consider the report of the CAG relating to the audit of any
receipt or to examine the accounts of stores and stocks
6.  To examine the money spent on any service during a financial year
in excess of the amount granted by the Lok Sabha for that purpose
In the fulfillment of the above functions, the committee is assisted by the
CAG. In fact, the CAG acts as a guide, friend and philosopher of the
committee.
On the role played by the committee, Ashok Chanda (who himself has
been a CAG of India) observed: “Over a period of years, the committee has
entirely fulfilled the expectation that it should develop into a powerful force
in the control of public expenditure. It may be claimed that the traditions
established and conventions developed by the Public Accounts Committee
conform to the highest traditions of a parliamentary democracy.”5
However, the effectiveness of the role of the committee is limited by the
following:
(a)  It is not concerned with the questions of policy in broader sense.
(b)  It conducts a post-mortem examination of accounts (showing the
expenditure already incurred).
(c)  It cannot intervene in the matters of day-to-day administration.
(d)  Its recommendations are advisory and not binding on the
ministries.
(e)  It is not vested with the power of disallowance of expenditures by
the departments.
(f)  It is not an executive body and hence, cannot issue an order. Only
the Parliament can take a final decision on its findings.
Estimates Committee
The origin of this committee can be traced to the standing financial
committee set up in 1921. The first Estimates Committee in the postindependence era was constituted in 1950 on the recommendation of John
Mathai, the then finance minister. Originally, it had 25 members but in 1956
its membership was raised to 30. All the thirty members are from Lok
Sabha only. The Rajya Sabha has no representation in this committee.
These members are elected by the Lok Sabha every year from amongst its
own members, according to the principles of proportional representation by
means of a single transferable vote. Thus, all parties get due representation
in it. The term of office is one year. A minister cannot be elected as a
member of the committee. The chairman of the committee is appointed by
the Speaker from amongst its members and he is invariably from the ruling
party.
The function of the committee is to examine the estimates included in the
budget and suggest ‘economies’ in public expenditure. Hence, it has been
described as a ‘continuous economy committee’.
In more detail, the functions of the committee are:
1.  To report what economies, improvements in organisation,
efficiency and administrative reform consistent with the policy
underlying the estimates, can be affected
2.  To suggest alternative policies in order to bring about efficiency
and economy in administration
3.  To examine whether the money is well laid out within the limits of
the policy implied in the estimates
4.  To suggest the form in which the estimates are to be presented to
Parliament
The Committee shall not exercise its functions in relation to such public
undertakings as are allotted to the Committee on Public Undertakings. The
Committee may continue the examination of the estimates from time to
time, throughout the financial year and report to the House as its
examination proceeds. It shall not be incumbent on the Committee to
examine the entire estimates of any one year. The demands for grants may
be finally voted despite the fact that the Committee has made no report.
However, the effectiveness of the role of the committee is limited by the
following:
(a)  It examines the budget estimates only after they have been voted
by the Parliament, and not before that.
(b)  It cannot question the policy laid down by the Parliament.
(c)  Its recommendations are advisory and not binding on the
ministries.
(d)  It examines every year only certain selected ministries and
departments. Thus, by rotation, it would cover all of them over a
number of years.
(e)  It lacks the expert assistance of the CAG which is available to the
Public Accounts Committee.
(f)  Its work is in the nature of a postmortem.
Committee on Public Undertakings
This committee was created in 1964 on the recommendation of the Krishna
Menon Committee. Originally, it had 15 members (10 from the Lok Sabha
and 5 from the Rajya Sabha). However, in 1974, its membership was raised
to 22 (15 from the Lok Sabha and 7 from the Rajya Sabha). The members
of this committee are elected by the Parliament every year from amongst its
own members according to the principle of proportional representation by
means of a single transferable vote. Thus, all parties get due representation
in it. The term of office of the members is one year. A minister cannot be
elected as a member of the committee. The chairman of the committee is
appointed by the Speaker from amongst its members who are drawn from
the Lok Sabha only. Thus, the members of the committee who are from the
Rajya Sabha cannot be appointed as the chairman.
The functions of the committee are:
1.  To examine the reports and accounts of public undertakings
2.  To examine the reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General on
public undertakings
3.  To examine (in the context of autonomy and efficiency of public
undertakings) whether the affairs of the public undertakings are being
managed in accordance with sound business principles and prudent
commercial practices
4.  To exercise such other functions vested in the public accounts
committee and the estimates committee in relation to public
undertakings which are allotted to it by the Speaker from time to time
The committee is not to examine and investigate any of the following:
(i) Matters of major government policy as distinct from business or
commercial functions of the public undertakings
(ii) Matters of day-to-day administration
(iii) Matters for the consideration of which machinery is established
by any special statute under which a particular public undertaking
is established
Further, the effectiveness of the role of the committee is limited by the
following:
(a)  It cannot take up the examination of more than ten to twelve public
undertakings in a year.
(b)  Its work is in the nature of a post-mortem.
(c)  It does not look into technical matters as its members are not
technical experts.
(d)  Its recommendations are advisory and not binding on the
ministries.
DEPARTMENTAL STANDING COMMITTEES
On the recommendation of the Rules Committee of the Lok Sabha, 17
Departmentally-Related Standing Committees (DRSCs) were set up in the
Parliament in 1993.6
In 2004, seven more such committees were setup, thus
increasing their number from 17 to 24.
The main objective of the standing committees is to secure more
accountability of the Executive (i.e., the Council of Ministers) to the
Parliament, particularly financial accountability. They also assist the
Parliament in debating the budget more effectively.
7
The 24 standing committees cover under their jurisdiction all the
ministries / departments of the Central Government.
Each standing committee consists of 31 members (21 from Lok Sabha
and 10 from Rajya Sabha). The members of the Lok Sabha are nominated
by the Speaker from amongst its own members, just as the members of the
Rajya Sabha are nominated by the Chairman from amongst its members.8
A minister is not eligible to be nominated as a member of any of the
standing committees. In case a member, after his nomination to any of the
standing committees, is appointed a minister, he then ceases to be a member
of the committee.
The term of office of each standing committee is one year from the date
of its constitution.
Out of the 24 standing committees, 8 work under the Rajya Sabha and 16
under the Lok Sabha.9
The 24 standing committees and the ministries / departments placed
under their jurisdiction are shown below in Table 23.1.
The functions of each of the standing committees are:
1.  To consider the demands for grants of the concerned ministries /
departments before they are discussed and voted in the Lok Sabha. Its
report should not suggest anything of the nature of cut motions
2.  To examine bills pertaining to the concerned ministries /
departments
3.  To consider annual reports of ministries / departments
4.  To consider national basic long-term policy documents presented to
the Houses
The following limitations are imposed on the functioning of these
standing committees:
(i)  They should not consider the matters of day-to-day administration
of the concerned ministries / departments.

as the ministries / departments would now be more careful in
formulating their demands.

participate and understand the functioning of the government and
contribute to it.
(6)  They can avail of expert opinion or public opinion to make the

25 Parliamentary Group
RATIONALE OF THE GROUP
M.N. Kaul and S.L. Shakdher have nicely explained the rationale of the
Indian Parliamentary Group (IPG) in the following way:
The establishment and development of relations among parliaments
constitutes part of the regular activities of national parliaments. Although
promotion of inter-parliamentary relations has for many years been a
significant part of the work of parliamentarians, recently it has received a
new thrust due to the increased inter-dependence of nations in a global
environment. It is imperative that parliamentarians will join hands to
safeguard democracy and work in synergy to confront the challenges before
the world and convert them into opportunities to facilitate peace and
prosperity in their countries as well as globally. Parliamentarians from
different parts of the world, therefore, have a forum where they can meet to
discuss and find out solutions to their common problems. It is here that
some sort of cross-fertilisation of ideas can take place not only between the
older and the younger parliaments, but also between parliamentarians
working under different parliamentary systems. These problems are no
doubt discussed in inter-governmental conferences; however, those
discussions are not so frank and free as they can be at a conclave of
legislators.1
Inter-parliamentary relations thus assume great importance today when
the whole world is beset with many pressing problems. The problems that
are faced by one parliament today may confront another tomorrow. It is,
therefore, essential that a link should exist between various parliaments of
the world. This link is maintained by India through the exchange of
delegations, goodwill missions, correspondence, documents, etc. with
foreign parliaments through the machinery of the IPG that acts both as the
National Group of the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) and also as the
India Branch of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association (CPA).2
COMPOSITION OF THE GROUP
IPG3
is an autonomous body. It was formed in the year 1949 in pursuance of
a motion adopted by the Constituent Assembly (Legislative).4
The membership of IPG is open to all members of Parliament. The
former members of Parliament can also become associate members of the
Group.5 But, the associate members are entitled to limited rights only. They
are not entitled to representation at meetings and conferences of the IPU
and the CPA. They are also not entitled to the travel concessions provided
to members by certain branches of the CPA.
The Speaker of the Lok Sabha is the ex officio president of the Group.
The Deputy Speaker of the Lok Sabha and the Deputy Chairman of the
Rajya Sabha are the ex officio vice-presidents of the Group. The
SecretaryGeneral of the Lok Sabha acts as the ex officio Secretary-General
of the Group.
OBJECTIVES OF THE GROUP
The aims and objects of the Group are mentioned below:
1.  To promote personal contacts between members of the Parliament
of India.
2.  To study questions of public importance that are likely to come up
before the Parliament; arrange seminars, discussions and orientation
courses; and bring out publications for the dissemination of
information to the members of the Group.
3.  To arrange lectures on political, defence, economic, social and
educational problems by the members of the Parliament and
distinguished persons.
4.  To arrange visits to foreign countries with a view to develop
contacts with members of other parliaments.
FUNCTIONS OF THE GROUP
The various functions performed and activities undertaken by the Group are
as follows:
1.  The Group acts as a link between the Parliament of India and the
various parliaments of the world. This link is maintained through
exchange of delegations, goodwill missions, correspondence,
documents, etc. with foreign parliaments.
2.  The Group functions as the (a) National Group of the IPU and (b)
main branch of the CPA in India.
3.  Addresses to the members of the Parliament by visiting Heads of
State and Government of foreign countries and talks by eminent
persons are arranged under the auspices of the Group.
4.  Seminars and symposia on parliamentary subjects of topical interest
are organised periodically at national as well as international level.
5.  Members of the Group, when visiting abroad, are given letters of
introduction to the Secretaries of the National Groups of the IPU and
Secretaries of the CPA branches. The Indian Missions in the countries
of visit are also suitably informed so as to enable them to get
assistance and usual courtesies.
6.  Only those members of the Parliament who are members of the
Group of at least six months’ standing at the time of the composition
of the delegation, may be included in the Indian Parliamentary
delegations to foreign countries.
7.  An uninterrupted flow of information to members regarding the
activities of the Group is maintained through the IPG Newsletter
brought out every quarter. It is sent regularly to all members of the
Group, including associate members.
8.  As per decision of the Group, an award of Outstanding
Parliamentarian was instituted in the year 1995 to be given annually. A
committee of five persons, constituted by the Speaker of the Lok
Sabha, invites and finalises the nomination for the award.
9.  To encourage bilateral relations, the Group constitutes
Parliamentary Friendship Groups with other countries in the
Parliament.6 The aims and objectives of the Friendship Group are to
maintain political, social and cultural contacts between the two
countries and to assist in exchanges of information and experiences on
issues relating to parliamentary activities.
THE GROUP AND IPU7
The IPU is an international organisation of the parliaments of sovereign
states. At present, the IPU consists of 153 parliaments of sovereign nations.
Its aim is to work for peace and cooperation among peoples and for the firm
establishment of representative institutions. It fosters contacts, coordination
and the exchange of experience among parliaments and parliamentarians of
all member countries and contributes to better knowledge of the working of
representative institutions. It also expresses its views on all burning
questions of international importance for necessary effective
implementation of parliamentary actions and suggests avenues for
improving the working standard and capacity of international institutions.
The main advantages of membership of the Group, insofar as its
functions as the National Group of the IPU are concerned, are as follows:
1.  It helps members of Indian Parliamentary delegations to develop
contacts with the parliamentarians of the member countries of the IPU.
2.  The events provide an opportunity to study and understand
contemporary changes/reforms taking place in various countries of the
world.
3.  It provides facilities to meet parliamentarians in different countries
during tours in abroad or in India when visiting Parliamentarians are
here.
4.  The members of the Group are eligible to visit foreign countries as
members of the Indian Parliamentary delegations to InterParliamentary Conferences.
In the recent past, members of the Group have been holding various
positions in the IPU bodies, namely, office bearers in different committees
of the IPU, Rapporteurs, Chairman of Drafting Committees, etc. and by
virtue of the same, the Group has been successful in putting forward
effectively the view point of India on various important issues dealt in the
IPU meetings.
THE GROUP AND CPA8
The CPA is an association of about 17000 Commonwealth Parliamentarians
spread over 175 National, State, Provincial and Territorial Parliaments. Its
aims are to promote knowledge and understanding of the constitutional,
legislative, economic, social and cultural systems within a parliamentary
democratic framework with particular reference to the countries of the
Commonwealth of Nations and to countries having close historical and
parliamentary associations with it. Its mission is to promote the
advancement of parliamentary democracy by enhancing knowledge and
understanding of democratic governance and by building an informed
parliamentary community able to deepen the Commonwealth’s democratic
commitment and to further co-operation among its parliaments and
legislatures.
The main advantages of membership of the Group, insofar as its
functions as the main branch of the CPA in India are concerned, are as
follows:
1.  Conferences and Seminars: Membership provides an opportunity
for participation in the plenary and regional conferences, seminars,
visits and exchanges of delegations.
2.  Publications: All members of the Group are entitled to receive,
free of charge, ‘The Parliamentarian’ quarterly and the newsletter,

26 Supreme Court
Unlike the American Constitution, the Indian Constitution has established
an integrated judicial system with the Supreme Court at thetop and the high
courts below it. Under a high court (and below the state level), there is a
hierarchy of subordinate courts, that is, district courts and other lower
courts. This single system of courts, adopted from the Government of India
Act of 1935, enforces both Central laws as well as the state laws. In USA,
on the other hand, the federal laws are enforced by the federal judiciary and
the state laws are enforced by the state judiciary. There is thus a double
system of courts in USA–one for the centre and the other for the states. To
sum up, India, although a federal country like the USA, has a unified
judiciary and one system of fundamental law and justice.
The Supreme Court of India was inaugurated on January 28, 1950. It
succeeded the Federal Court of India, established under the Government of
India Act of 1935. However, the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court is
greater than that of its predecessor. This is because, the Supreme Court has
replaced the British Privy Council as the highest court of appeal.1
Articles 124 to 147 in Part V of the Constitution deal with the
organisation, independence, jurisdiction, powers, procedures and so on of
the Supreme Court. The Parliament is also authorised to regulate them.
COMPOSITION AND APPOINTMENT
At present, the Supreme Court consists of thirty-four judges (one chief
justice and thirty three other judges). In 2019, the centre notified an
increase in the number of Supreme Court judges from thirty-one to thirtyfour, including the Chief Justice of India. This followed the enactment of
the Supreme Court (Number of Judges) Amendment Act, 2019. Originally,
the strength of the Supreme Court was fixed at eight (one chief justice and
seven other judges). The Parliament has increased this number of other
judges progressively to ten in 1956, to thirteen in 1960, to seventeen in
1977, to twenty-five in 1986, to thirty in 2008 and to thirty-three in 2019.
Appointment of Judges
The judges of the Supreme Court are appointed by the president. The chief
justice is appointed by the president after consultation with such judges of
the Supreme Court and high courts as he deems necessary. The other judges
are appointed by president after consultation with the chief justice and such
other judges of the Supreme Court and the high courts as he deems
necessary. The consultation with the chief justice is obligatory in the case of
appointment of a judge other than Chief justice.
Controversy over Consultation
The Supreme Court has given different interpretation of the word
‘consultation’ in the above provision. In the First Judges case (1982), the
Court held that consultation does not mean concurrence and it only implies
exchange of views. But, in the Second Judges case (1993), the Court
reversed its earlier ruling and changed the meaning of the word consultation
to concurrence. Hence, it ruled that the advice tendered by the Chief Justice
of India is binding on the President in the matters of appointment of the
judges of the Supreme Court. But, the Chief Justice would tender his advice
on the matter after consulting two of his seniormost colleagues. Similarly,
in the Third Judges case2
(1998), the Court opined that the consultation
process to be adopted by the Chief justice of India requires ‘consultation of
plurality judges’. The sole opinion of the chief justice of India does not
constitute the consultation process. He should consult a collegium of four
seniormost judges of the Supreme Court and even if two judges give an
adverse opinion, he should not send the recommendation to the
government. The court held that the recommendation made by the chief
justice of India without complying with the norms and requirements of the
consultation process are not binding on the government.
The 99th Constitutional Amendment Act of 2014 and the National Judicial
Appointments Commission Act of 2014 have replaced the collegium system
of appointing judges to the Supreme Court and High Courts with a new
body called the National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC).
However, in 2015, the Supreme Court has declared both the 99th
Constitutional Amendment as well as the NJAC Act as unconstitutional and
void. Consequently, the earlier collegium system became operative again.
This verdict was delivered by the Supreme Court in the Fourth Judges case2a
(2015). The court opined that the new system (i.e., NJAC) would affect the
independence of the judiciary.
Appointment of Chief
Justice From 1950 to 1973, the practice has been to appoint the seniormost
judge of the Supreme Court as the chief justice of India. This established
convention was violated in 1973 when A.N. Ray was appointed as the Chief
Justice of India by superseding three senior judges.3 Again in 1977, M.U.
Beg was appointed as the chief justice of India by superseding the then
senior-most judge.4 This discretion of the government was curtailed by the
Supreme Court in the Second Judges Case (1993), in which the Supreme
Court ruled that the seniormost judge of the Supreme Court should alone be
appointed to the office of the chief justice of India.
QUALIFICATIONS, OATH AND SALARIES
Qualifications of Judges
A person to be appointed as a judge of the Supreme Court should have the
following qualifications:
1.  He should be a citizen of India.
2.  (a) He should have been a judge of a High Court (or high courts in
succession) for five years; or (b) He should have been an advocate of a
High Court (or High Courts in succession) for ten years; or (c) He
should be a distinguished jurist in the opinion of the president.
From the above, it is clear that the Constitution has not prescribed a
minimum age for appointment as a judge of the Supreme Court.
Oath or Affirmation
A person appointed as a judge of the Supreme Court, before entering upon
his Office, has to make and subscribe an oath or affirmation before the
President, or some person appointed by him for this purpose. In his oath, a
judge of the Supreme Court swears:
1.  to bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of India;
2.  to uphold the sovereignty and integrity of India;
3.  to duly and faithfully and to the best of his ability, knowledge and
judgement perform the duties of the Office without fear or favour,
affection or ill-will; and
4.  to uphold the Constitution and the laws.
Salaries and Allowances
The salaries, allowances, privileges, leave and pension of the judges of the
Supreme Court are determined from time to time by the Parliament. They
cannot be varied to their disadvantage after their appointment except during
a financial emergency. In 2018, the salary of the chief justice was increased
from ₹1 lakh to ₹2.80 lakh per month and that of a judge from ₹90,000 to
₹2.50 lakh per month6
. They are also paid sumptuary allowance and
provided with free accommodation and other facilities like medical, car,
telephone, etc.
The retired chief justice and judges are entitled to 50 per cent of their last
drawn salary as monthly pension.
TENURE AND REMOVAL
Tenure of Judges
The Constitution has not fixed the tenure of a judge of the Supreme Court.
However, it makes the following three provisions in this regard:
1.  He holds office until he attains the age of 65 years. Any question
regarding his age is to be determined by such authority and in such
manner as provided by Parliament.
2.  He can resign his office by writing to the president.
3.  He can be removed from his office by the President on the
recommendation of the Parliament.
Removal of Judges
A judge of the Supreme Court can be removed from his Office by an order
of the president. The President can issue the removal order only after an
address by Parliament has been presented to him in the same session for
such removal.5 The address must be supported by a special majority of each
House of Parliament (ie, a majority of the total membership of that House
and a majority of not less than two-thirds of the members of that House
present and voting). The grounds of removal are two–proved misbehaviour
or incapacity.
The Judges Enquiry Act (1968) regulates the procedure relating to the
removal of a judge of the Supreme Court by the process of impeachment:
1.  A removal motion signed by 100 members (in the case of Lok
Sabha) or 50 members (in the case of Rajya Sabha) is to be given to
the Speaker/ Chairman.
2.  The Speaker/Chairman may admit the motion or refuse to admit it.
3.  If it is admitted, then the Speaker/ Chairman is to constitute a threemember committee to investigate into the charges.
4.  The committee should consist of (a) the chief justice or a judge of
the Supreme Court, (b) a chief justice of a high court, and (c) a
distinguished jurist.
5.  If the committee finds the judge to be guilty of misbehaviour or
suffering from an incapacity, the House can take up the consideration
of the motion.
6.  After the motion is passed by each House of Parliament by special
majority, an address is presented to the president for removal of the
judge.
7.  Finally, the president passes an order removing the judge.
It is interesting to know that no judge of the Supreme Court has been
impeached so far. The first case of impeachment is that of Justice V.
Ramaswami of the Supreme Court (1991–1993). Though the enquiry
Committee found him guilty of misbehaviour, he could not be removed as
the impeachment motion was defeated in the Lok Sabha. The Congress
Party abstained from voting.
ACTING, ADHOC AND RETIRED JUDGES
Acting Chief Justice
The President can appoint a judge of the Supreme Court as an acting Chief
Justice of India when:
1.  the office of Chief Justice of India is vacant; or
2.  the Chief Justice of India is temporarily absent; or
3.  the Chief Justice of India is unable to perform the duties of his
office.
Ad hoc Judge
When there is a lack of quorum of the permanent judges to hold or continue
any session of the Supreme Court, the Chief Justice of India can appoint a
judge of a High Court as an ad hoc judge of the Supreme Court for a
temporary period. He can do so only after consultation with the chief justice
of the High Court concerned and with the previous consent of the president.
The judge so appointed should be qualified for appointment as a judge of
the Supreme Court. It is the duty of the judge so appointed to attend the
sittings of the Supreme Court, in priority to other duties of his office. While
so attending, he enjoys all the jurisdiction, powers and privileges (and
discharges the duties) of a judge of the Supreme Court.
Retired Judge
At any time, the chief justice of India can request a retired judge of the
Supreme Court or a retired judge of a high court (who is duly qualified for
appointment as a judge of the Supreme Court) to act as a judge of the
Supreme Court for a temporary period. He can do so only with the previous
consent of the president and also of the person to be so appointed. Such a
judge is entitled to such allowances as the president may determine. He will
also enjoy all the jurisdiction, powers and privileges of a judge of Supreme
Court. But, he will not otherwise be deemed to be a judge of the Supreme
Court.
SEAT AND PROCEDURE
Seat of Supreme Court
The Constitution declares Delhi as the seat of the Supreme Court. But, it
also authorises the chief justice of India to appoint other place or places as
seat of the Supreme Court. He can take decision in this regard only with the
approval of the President. This provision is only optional and not
compulsory. This means that no court can give any direction either to the
President or to the Chief Justice to appoint any other place as a seat of the
Supreme Court.
Procedure of the Court
The Supreme Court can, with the approval of the president, make rules for
regulating generally the practice and procedure of the Court. The
Constitutional cases or references made by the President under Article 143
are decided by a Bench consisting of at least five judges. All other cases are
decided by single judges and division benches. The judgements are
delivered by the open court. All judgements are by majority vote but if
differing, then judges can give dissenting judgements or opinions.
INDEPENDENCE OF SUPREME COURT
The Supreme Court has been assigned a very significant role in the Indian
democratic political system. It is a federal court, the highest court of appeal,
the guarantor of the fundamental rights of the citizens and guardian of the
Constitution. Therefore, its independence becomes very essential for the
effective discharge of the duties assigned to it. It should be free from the
encroachments, pressures and interferences of the executive (council of
ministers) and the Legislature (Parliament). It should be allowed to do
justice without fear or favour.
The Constitution has made the following provisions to safeguard and
ensure the independent and impartial functioning of the Supreme Court:
1. Mode of Appointment
The judges of the Supreme Court are appointed by the President (which
means the cabinet) in consultation with the members of the judiciary itself
(ie, judges of the Supreme Court and the high courts). This provision
curtails the absolute discretion of the executive as well as ensures that the
judicial appointments are not based on any political or practical
considerations.
2. Security of Tenure
The judges of the Supreme Court are provided with the Security of Tenure.
They can be removed from office by the President only in the manner and
on the grounds mentioned in the Constitution. This means that they do not
hold their office during the pleasure of the President, though they are
appointed by him. This is obvious from the fact that no judge of the
Supreme Court has been removed (or impeached) so far.
3. Fixed Service Conditions
The salaries, allowances, privileges, leave and pension of the judges of the
Supreme Court are determined from time to time by the Parliament. They
cannot be changed to their disadvantage after their appointment except
during a financial emergency. Thus, the conditions of service of the judges
of the Supreme Court remain same during their term of Office.
4. Expenses Charged on Consolidated Fund
The salaries, allowances and pensions of the judges and the staff as well as
all the administrative expenses of the Supreme Court are charged on the
Consolidated Fund of India. Thus, they are non-votable by the Parliament
(though they can be discussed by it).
5. Conduct of Judges cannot be Discussed
The Constitution prohibits any discussion in Parliament or in a State
Legislature with respect to the conduct of the judges of the Supreme Court
in the discharge of their duties, except when an impeachment motion is
under consideration of the Parliament.
6. Ban on Practice after Retirement
The retired judges of the Supreme Court are prohibited from pleading or
acting in any Court or before any authority within the territory of India.
This ensures that they do not favour any one in the hope of future favour.
7. Power to Punish for its Contempt
The Supreme Court can punish any person for its contempt. Thus, its
actions and decisions cannot be criticised and opposed by any body. This
power is vested in the Supreme Court to maintain its authority, dignity and
honour.
8. Freedom to Appoint its Staff
The Chief Justice of India can appoint officers and servants of the Supreme
Court without any interference from the executive. He can also prescribe
their conditions of service.
9. Its Jurisdiction cannot be Curtailed
The Parliament is not authorised to curtail the jurisdiction and powers of the
Supreme Court. The Constitution has guaranteed to the Supreme Court,
jurisdiction of various kinds. However, the Parliament can extend the same.
10. Separation from Executive
The Constitution directs the State to take steps to separate the Judiciary
from the Executive in the public services. This means that the executive
authorities should not possess the judicial powers. Consequently, upon its
implementation, the role of executive authorities in judicial administration
came to an end.7
JURISDICTION AND POWERS OF SUPREME COURT
The Constitution has conferred a very extensive jurisdiction and vast
powers on the Supreme Court. It is not only a Federal Court like the
American Supreme Court but also a final court of appeal like the British
House of Lords (the Upper House of the British Parliament). It is also the
final interpreter and guardian of the Constitution and guarantor of the
fundamental rights of the citizens. Further, it has advisory and supervisory
powers. Therefore, Alladi Krishnaswamy Ayyar, a member of the Drafting
Committee of the Constitution, rightly remarked: “The Supreme Court of
India has more powers than any other Supreme Court in any part of the
world.” The jurisdiction and powers of the Supreme Court can be classified
into the following:
1.  Original Jurisdiction.
2.  Writ Jurisdiction.
3.  Appellate Jurisdiction.
4.  Advisory Jurisdiction.
5.  A Court of Record.
6.  Power of Judicial Review.
7.  Constitutional Interpretation
8.  Other Powers.
1. Original Jurisdiction
As a federal court, the Supreme Court decides the disputes between
different units of the Indian Federation. More elaborately, any dispute:
(a)  Between the Centre and one or more states; or
(b)  Between the Centre and any state or states on one side and one or
more other states on the other side; or
(c)  Between two or more states.
In the above federal disputes, the Supreme Court has exclusive original
jurisdiction. Exclusive means, no other court can decide such disputes and
original means, the power to hear such disputes in the first instance, not by
way of appeal.
With regard to the exclusive original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court,
two points should be noted. One, the dispute must involve a question
(whether of law or fact) on which the existence or extent of a legal right
depends. Thus, the questions of political nature are excluded from it. Two,
any suit brought before the Supreme Court by a private citizen against the
Centre or a state cannot be entertained under this.
Further, this jurisdiction of the Supreme Court does not extend to the
following:
(a)  A dispute arising out of any pre-Constitution treaty, agreement,
covenant, engagement, sanad or other similar instrument.8
(b)  A dispute arising out of any treaty, agreement, etc., which
specifically provides that the said jurisdiction does not extent to such a
dispute.9
(c)  Inter-state water disputes.10
(d)  Matters referred to the Finance Commission.
(e)  Adjustment of certain expenses and pensions between the Centre
and the states.
(f)  Ordinary dispute of Commercial nature between the Centre and the
states.
(g)  Recovery of damages by a state against the Centre.
In 1961, the first suit, under the original jurisdiction of the Supreme
Court, was brought by West Bengal against the Centre. The State
Government challenged the Constitutional validity of the Coal Bearing
Areas (Acquisition and Development) Act, 1957, passed by the Parliament.
However, the Supreme Court dismissed the suit by upholding the validity of
the Act.
2. Writ Jurisdiction
The Constitution has constituted the Supreme Court as the guarantor and
defender of the fundamental rights of the citizens. The Supreme Court is
empowered to issue writs including habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition,
quo warranto and certiorari for the enforcement of the fundamental rights
of an aggrieved citizen. In this regard, the Supreme Court has original
jurisdiction in the sense that an aggrieved citizen can directly go to the
Supreme Court, not necessarily by way of appeal. However, the writ
jurisdiction of the Supreme Court is not exclusive. The high courts are also
empowered to issue writs for the enforcement of the Fundamental Rights. It
means, when the Fundamental Rights of a citizen are violated, the
aggrieved party has the option of moving either the high court or the
Supreme Court directly.
Therefore, the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court with regard to
federal disputes is different from its original jurisdiction with regard to
disputes relating to fundamental rights. In the first case, it is exclusive and
in the second case, it is concurrent with high courts jurisdiction. Moreover,
the parties involved in the first case are units of the federation (Centre and
states) while the dispute in the second case is between a citizen and the
Government (Central or state).
There is also a difference between the writ jurisdiction of the Supreme
Court and that of the high court. The Supreme Court can issue writs only
for the enforcement of the Fundamental Rights and not for other purposes.
The high court, on the other hand, can issue writs not only for the
enforcement of the fundamental rights but also for other purposes. It means
that the writ jurisdiction of the high court is wider than that of the Supreme
Court. But, the Parliament can confer on the Supreme Court, the power to
issue writs for other purposes also.
3. Appellate Jurisdiction
As mentioned earlier, the Supreme Court has not only succeeded the
Federal Court of India but also replaced the British Privy Council as the
highest court of appeal. The Supreme Court is primarily a court of appeal
and hears appeals against the judgements of the lower courts. It enjoys a
wide appellate jurisdiction which can be classified under four heads:
(a)  Appeals in constitutional matters.
(b)  Appeals in civil matters.
(c)  Appeals in criminal matters.
(d)  Appeals by special leave.
(a) Constitutional Matters
In the constitutional cases, an appeal can be made to the Supreme Court
against the judgement of a high court if the high court certifies that the case
involves a substantial question of law that requires the interpretation of the
Constitution. Based on the certificate, the party in the case can appeal to the
Supreme Court on the ground that the question has been wrongly decided.
(b) Civil Matters
In civil cases, an appeal lies to the Supreme Court from any judgement of a
high court if the high court certifies–
(i) that the case involves a substantial question of law of general
importance; and
(ii) that the question needs to be decided by the Supreme Court.
Originally, only those civil cases that involved a sum of ₹20,000 could
be appealed before the Supreme Court. But this monetary limit was
removed by the 30th Constitutional Amendment Act of 1972.
(c) Criminal Matters
The Supreme Court hears appeals against the judgement in a criminal
proceeding of a high court if the high court–
(i) has on appeal reversed an order of acquittal of an accused person
and sentenced him to death; or
(ii) has taken before itself any case from any subordinate court and
convicted the accused person and sentenced him to death; or
(iii) certifies that the case is a fit one for appeal to the Supreme Court.
In the first two cases, an appeal lies to the Supreme Court as a matter of
right (ie, without any certificate of the high court). But if the high court has
reversed the order of conviction and has ordered the acquittal of the
accused, there is no right to appeal to the Supreme Court.
In 1970, the Parliament had enlarged the Criminal Appellate Jurisdiction
of the Supreme Court. Accordingly, an appeal lies to the Supreme Court
from the judgement of a high court if the high court:
(i) has on appeal, reversed an order of acquittal of an accused person
and sentenced him to imprisonment for life or for ten years; or
(ii) has taken before itself any case from any subordinate court and
convicted the accused person and sentenced him to imprisonment
for life or for ten years.
Further, the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court extends to all
civil and criminal cases in which the Federal Court of India had jurisdiction
to hear appeals from the high court but which are not covered under the
civil and criminal appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court mentioned
above.
(d) Appeal by Special Leave
The Supreme Court is authorised to grant in its discretion special leave to
appeal from any judgement in any matter passed by any court or tribunal in
the country (except military tribunal and court martial). This provision
contains the four aspects as under:
(i) It is a discretionary power and hence, cannot be claimed as a
matter of right.
(ii) It can be granted in any judgement whether final or interlocutory.
(iii) It may be related to any matter–constitutional, civil, criminal,
income-tax, labour, revenue, advocates, etc.
(iv) It can be granted against any court or tribunal and not necessarily
against a high court (of course, except a military court).
Thus, the scope of this provision is very wide and it vests the Supreme
Court with a plenary jurisdiction to hear appeals. On the exercise of this
power, the Supreme Court itself held that ‘being an exceptional and
overriding power, it has to be exercised sparingly and with caution and only
in special extraordinary situations. Beyond that it is not possible to fetter the
exercise of this power by any set formula or rule’.
4. Advisory Jurisdiction
The Constitution (Article 143) authorises the president to seek the opinion
of the Supreme Court in the two categories of matters:
(a)  On any question of law or fact of public importance which has
arisen or which is likely to arise.
(b)  On any dispute arising out of any pre-constitution treaty,
agreement, covenant, engagement, sanad or other similar instruments.11
In the first case, the Supreme Court may tender or may refuse to tender
its opinion to the president. But, in the second case, the Supreme Court
‘must’ tender its opinion to the president. In both the cases, the opinion
expressed by the Supreme Court is only advisory and not a judicial
pronouncement. Hence, it is not binding on the president; he may follow or
may not follow the opinion. However, it facilitates the government to have
an authoritative legal opinion on a matter to be decided by it.
So far (2019), the President has made fifteen references to the Supreme
Court under its advisory jurisdiction (also known as consultative
jurisdiction). These are mentioned below in the chronological order.
1.  Delhi Laws Act in 1951
2.  Kerala Education Bill in 1958
3.  Berubari Union in 1960
4.  Sea Customs Act in 1963
5.  Keshav Singh’s case relating to the privileges of the Legislature in
1964
6.  Presidential Election in 1974
7.  Special Courts Bill in 1978
8.  Jammu and Kashmir Resettlement Act in 1982
9.  Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal in 1992
10.  Rama Janma Bhumi case in 1993
11.  Consultation process to be adopted by the chief justice of India in
1998
12.  Legislative competence of the Centre and States on the subject of
natural gas and liquefied natural gas in 2001
13.  The constitutional validity of the Election Commission’s decision
on deferring the Gujarat Assembly Elections in 2002
14.  Punjab Termination of Agreements Act in 2004
15.  2G spectrum case verdict and the mandatory auctioning of natural
resources across all sectors in 2012
5. A Court of Record
As a Court of Record, the Supreme Court has two powers:
(a)  The judgements, proceedings and acts of the Supreme Court are
recorded for perpetual memory and testimony. These records are
admitted to be of evidentiary value and cannot be questioned when
produced before any court. They are recognised as legal precedents
and legal references.
(b)  It has power to punish for contempt of court, either with simple
imprisonment for a term up to six months or with fine up to ₹2,000 or
with both. In 1991, the Supreme Court has ruled that it has power to
punish for contempt not only of itself but also of high courts,
subordinate courts and tribunals functioning in the entire country.
Contempt of court may be civil or criminal. Civil contempt means wilful
disobedience to any judgement, order, writ or other process of a court or
wilful breach of an undertaking given to a court. Criminal contempt means
the publication of any matter or doing an act which–(i) scandalises or
lowers the authority of a court; or (ii) prejudices or interferes with the due
course of a judicial proceeding; or (iii) interferes or obstructs the
administration of justice in any other manner.
However, innocent publication and distribution of some matter, fair and
accurate report of judicial proceedings, fair and reasonable criticism of
judicial acts and comment on the administrative side of the judiciary do not
amount to contempt of court.
6. Power of Judicial Review
Judicial review is the power of the Supreme Court to examine the
constitutionality of legislative enactments and executive orders of both the
Central and state governments. On examination, if they are found to be
violative of the Constitution (ultra-vires), they can be declared as illegal,
unconstitutional and invalid (null and void) by the Supreme Court.
Consequently, they cannot be enforced by the Government.
7. Constitutional Interpretation
The Supreme Court is the ultimate interpreter of the Constitution. It can
give final version to the spirit and content of the provisions of the
constitution and the verbiage used in the constitution.
While interpreting the constitution, the Supreme Court is guided by a
number of doctrines. In other words, the Supreme Court applies various
doctrines in interpreting the constitution. The important doctrines are
mentioned below:
1.  Doctrine of Severability
2.  Doctrine of Waiver
3.  Doctrine of Eclipse
4.  Doctrine of Territorial Nexus
5.  Doctrine of Pith and Substance
6.  Doctrine of Colourable Legislation
7.  Doctrine of Implied Powers
8.  Doctrine of Incidental and Ancillary Powers
9.  Doctrine of Precedent
10.  Doctrine of Occupied Field
11.  Doctrine of Prospective Overruling
12.  Doctrine of Harmonious Construction
13.  Doctrine of Liberal Interpretation
8. Other Powers
Besides the above, the Supreme Court has numerous other powers:
(a)  It decides the disputes regarding the election of the president and
the vicepresident. In this regard, it has the original, exclusive and final
authority.
(b)  It enquires into the conduct and behaviour of the chairman and
members of the Union Public Service Commission on a reference
made by the president. If it finds them guilty of misbehaviour, it can
recommend to the president for their removal. The advice tendered by
the Supreme Court in this regard is binding on the President.
(c)  It has power to review its own judgement or order. Thus, it is not
bound by its previous decision and can depart from it in the interest of
justice or community welfare. In brief, the Supreme Court is a selfcorrecting agency. For example, in the Kesavananda Bharati case
(1973), the Supreme Court departed from its previous judgement in the
Golak Nath case (1967).
(d)  It is authorised to withdraw the cases pending before the high
courts and dispose them by itself. It can also transfer a case or appeal
pending before one high court to another high court.
(e)  Its law is binding on all courts in India. Its decree or order is
enforceable throughout the country. All authorities (civil and judicial)
in the country should act in aid of the Supreme Court.
(f)  It has power of judicial superintendence and control over all the
courts and tribunals functioning in the entire territory of the country.
The Supreme Court’s jurisdiction and powers with respect to matters in
the Union list can be enlarged by the Parliament. Further, its jurisdiction
and powers with respect to other matters can be enlarged by a special
agreement of the Centre and the states.
SUPREME COURT ADVOCATES
Three categories of Advocates are entitled to practice law before the
Supreme Court. They are:
1. Senior Advocates
These are Advocates who are designated as Senior Advocates by the
Supreme Court of India or by any High Court. The Court can designate any
Advocate, with his consent, as Senior Advocate if in its opinion by virtue of
his ability, standing at the Bar or special knowledge or experience in law
the said Advocate is deserving of such distinction. A Senior Advocate is not
entitled to appear without an Advocate-on-Record in the Supreme Court or
without a junior in any other court or tribunal in India. He is also not
entitled to accept instructions to draw pleadings or affidavits, advise on
evidence or do any drafting work of an analogous kind in any court or
tribunal in India or undertake conveyancing work of any kind whatsoever
but this prohibition shall not extend to settling any such matter as aforesaid
in consultation with a junior.
2. Advocates-on-Record
Only these advocates are entitled to file any matter or document before the
Supreme Court. They can also file an appearance or act for a party in the
Supreme Court.
3. Other Advocates
These are advocates whose names are entered on the roll of any State Bar
Council maintained under the Advocates Act, 1961 and they can appear and
argue any matter on behalf of a party in the Supreme Court but they are not
entitled to file any document or matter before the Court.

27 Judicial Review
The doctrine of judicial review originated and developed in the USA. It
was propounded for the first time in the famous case of Marbury versus
Madison (1803) by John Marshall, the then chief justice of the American
Supreme Court.
In India, on the other hand, the Constitution itself confers the power of
judicial review on the judiciary (both the Supreme Court as well as High
Courts). Further, the Supreme Court has declared the power of judicial
review as a basic feature of the Constitution or an element of the basic
structure of the Constitution. Hence, the power of judicial review cannot be
curtailed or excluded even by a constitutional amendment.
MEANING OF JUDICIAL REVIEW
Judicial review is the power of the judiciary to examine the constitutionality
of legislative enactments and executive orders of both the Central and State
governments. On examination, if they are found to be violative of the
Constitution (ultra vires), they can be declared as illegal, unconstitutional
and invalid (null and void) by the judiciary. Consequently, they cannot be
enforced by the Government.
Justice Syed Shah Mohamed Quadri has classified the judicial review
into the following three categories1
 :
1.  Judicial review of constitutional amendments.
2.  Judicial review of legislation of the Parliament and State
Legislatures and subordinate legislations.
3.  Judicial review of administrative action of the Union and State and
authorities under the state.
The Supreme Court used the power of judicial review in various cases, as
for example, the Golaknath case (1967), the Bank Nationalisation case
(1970), the Privy Purses Abolition case (1971), the Kesavananda Bharati
case (1973), the Minerva Mills case (1980), and so on.
In 2015, the Supreme Court declared both the 99th Constitutional
Amendment, 2014 and the National Judicial Appointments Commission
(NJAC) Act, 2014 as unconstitutional and null and void.
IMPORTANCE OF JUDICIAL REVIEW
Judicial review is needed for the following reasons:
(a)  To uphold the principle of the supremacy of the Constitution.
(b)  To maintain federal equilibrium (balance between the Centre and
the states).
(c)  To protect the Fundamental Rights of the citizens.
In a number of cases, the Supreme Court has pointed out the significance
of the power of judicial review in our country. Some of the observations
made by it, in this regard, are given below:
“In India it is the Constitution that is supreme and that a statute law to be
valid, must be in conformity with the constitutional requirements and it is
for the judiciary to decide whether any enactment is constitutional or not”.2
“Our constitution contains express provisions for judicial review of
legislation as to its conformity with the constitution. This is especially true
as regards the Fundamental Rights, to which the court has been assigned the
role of sentinel on the qui vive”.3
“As long as some Fundamental Rights exist and are a part of the
Constitution, the power of judicial review has also to be exercised with a
view to see that the guarantees afforded by these Rights are not
contravened”.4
“The Constitution is supreme lex, the permanent law of the land, and
there is no branch of government above it. Every organ of government, be it
the executive or the legislature of the judiciary, derives its authority from
the Constitution and it has to act within the limits of its authority. No one
however highly placed and no authority howsoever lofty, can claim that it
shall be the sole judge of the extent of its power under the Constitution or
whether its action is within the confines of such power laid down by the
constitution. This Court is the ultimate interpreter of the Constitution and to
this Court is assigned the delicate task of determining what is the power
conferred on each branch of government, whether it is limited, and if so,
what are the limits and whether any action of that branch transgresses such
limits”.5
“It is the function of the Judges, may their duty, to pronounce upon the
validity of laws. If courts are totally deprived of that power, the
Fundamental Rights conferred on the people will become a mere adornment
because rights without remedies are as writ in water. A controlled
Constitution will then become uncontrolled”.6
“The judges of the Supreme Court have been entrusted with the task of
upholding the Constitution and to this end, have been conferred the power
to interpret it. It is they who have to ensure that the balance of power
envisaged by the Constitution is maintained and that the legislature and the
executive do not, in the discharge of their functions, transgress
constitutional limitations”7
 .
“The founding fathers very wisely, therefore, incorporated in the
Constitution itself the provisions of judicial review so as to maintain the
balance of federalism, to protect the Fundamental Rights and Fundamental
Freedoms guaranteed to the citizens and to afford a useful weapon for
availability, availment and enjoyment of equality, liberty and Fundamental
Freedoms and to help to create a healthy nationalism. The function of
judicial review is a part of the constitutional interpretation itself. It adjusts
the Constitution to meet new conditions and needs of the time”.8
CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS FOR JUDICIAL
REVIEW
Though the phrase ‘Judicial Review’ has nowhere been used in the
Constitution, the provisions of several Articles explicitly confer the power
of judicial review on the Supreme Court and the High Courts. These
provisions are explained below:
1.  Article 13 declares that all laws that are inconsistent with or in
derogation of the Fundamental Rights shall be null and void.
2.  Article 32 guarantees the right to move the Supreme Court for the
enforcement of the Fundamental Rights and empowers the Supreme
Court to issue directions or orders or writs for that purpose.
3.  Article 131 provides for the original jurisdiction of the Supreme
Court in centre-state and inter-state disputes.
4.  Article 132 provides for the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme
Court in constitutional cases.
5.  Article 133 provides for the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme
Court in civil cases.
6.  Article 134 provides for the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme
Court in criminal cases.
7.  Article 134-A deals with the certificate for appeal to the Supreme
Court from the High Courts.9
8.  Article 135 empowers the Supreme Court to exercise the
jurisdiction and powers of the Federal Court under any preconstitution
law.
9.  Article 136 authorises the Supreme Court to grant special leave to
appeal from any court or tribunal (except military tribunal and court
martial).
10.  Article 143 authorises the President to seek the opinion of the
Supreme Court on any question of law or fact and on any preconstitution legal matters.
11.  Article 226 empowers the High Courts to issue directions or
orders or writs for the enforcement of the Fundamental Rights and for
any other purpose.
12.  Article 227 vests in the High Courts the power of superintendence
over all courts and tribunals within their respective territorial
jurisdictions (except military courts or tribunals).
13.  Article 245 deals with the territorial extent of laws made by
Parliament and by the Legislatures of States.
14.  Article 246 deals with the subject matter of laws made by
Parliament and by the Legislatures of States (i.e., Union List, State List
and Concurrent List).
15.  Articles 251 and 254 provide that in case of a conflict between the
central law and state law, the central law prevails over the state law
and the state law shall be void.
16.  Article 372 deals with the continuance in force of the preconstitution laws.
SCOPE OF JUDICIAL REVIEW
The constitutional validity of a legislative enactment or an executive order
can be challenged in the Supreme Court or in the High Courts on the
following three grounds.
(a)  it infringes the Fundamental Rights (Part III),
(b)  it is outside the competence of the authority which has framed it,
and
(c)  it is repugnant to the constitutional provisions.
From the above, it is clear that the scope of judicial review in India is
narrower than what exists in the USA, though the American Constitution
does not explicitly mention the concept of judicial review in any of its
provisions. This is because, the American Constitution provides for ‘due
process of law’ against that of ‘procedure established by law’ which is
contained in the Indian Constitution. The difference between the two is:
“The due process of law gives wide scope to the Supreme Court to grant
protection to the rights of its citizens. It can declare laws violative of these
rights void not only on substantive grounds of being unlawful, but also on
procedural grounds of being unreasonable. Our Supreme Court, while
determining the constitutionality of a law, however examines only the
substantive question i.e., whether the law is within the powers of the
authority concerned or not. It is not expected to go into the question of its
reasonableness, suitability or policy implications”.10
The exercise of wide power of judicial review by the American Supreme
Court in the name of ‘due process of law’ clause has made the critics to
describe it as a ‘third chamber’ of the Legislature, a super-legislature, the
arbiter of social policy and so on. This American principle of judicial
supremacy is also recognised in our constitutional system, but to a limited
extent. Nor do we fully follow the British Principle of parliamentary
supremacy. There are many limitations on the sovereignty of Parliament in
our country, like the written character of the Constitution, the federalism
with division of powers, the Fundamental Rights and the judicial review. In
effect, what exists in India is a synthesis of both, that is, the American
principle of judicial supremacy and the British principle of parliamentary
supremacy.
JUDICIAL REVIEW OF THE NINTH SCHEDULE
Article 31B saves the acts and regulations included in the Ninth Schedule
from being challenged and invalidated on the ground of contravention of
any of the Fundamental Rights. Article 31B along with the Ninth Schedule
was added by the 1st
 Constitutional Amendment Act of 1951.
Originally (in 1951), the Ninth Schedule contained only 13 acts and
regulations but at present (in 2016) their number is 282.11 Of these, the acts
and regulations of the state legislature deal with land reforms and abolition
of the zamindari system and that of the Parliament deal with other matters.
However, in a significant judgement delivered in I.R. Coelho case
(2007)12
, the Supreme Court ruled that there could not be any blanket
immunity from judicial review of laws included in the Ninth Schedule. The
court held that judicial review is a ‘basic feature’ of the constitution and it
could not be taken away by putting a law under the Ninth Schedule. It said
that the laws placed under the Ninth Schedule after April 24, 1973, are open
to challenge in court if they violated Fundamental Rights guaranteed under
the Articles 14, 15, 19 and 21 or the ‘basic structure’ of the Constitution. It
was on April 24, 1973, that the Supreme Court first propounded the
doctrine of ‘basic structure’ or ‘basic features’ of the constitution in its
landmark verdict in the Kesavananda Bharati case.13
While delivering the above judgement, the Supreme Court made the
following conclusions:
1.  A law that abrogates or abridges rights guaranteed by Part III of the
Constitution may violate the basic structure doctrine, or it may not. If
former is the consequence of law, whether by an amendment of any
Article of Part III or by an insertion in the Ninth Schedule, such law
will have to be invalidated in the exercise of judicial review power of
the Court. The constitutional validity of the Ninth Schedule laws on
the touchstone of basic structure doctrine can be adjudged by applying
the direct impact and effect test, i.e., rights test, which means the form
of an amendment is not the relevant factor, but the consequence
thereof would be the determinative factor.
2.  The majority judgement in the Kesavanand Bharati Case14
read with
Indira Gandhi case15
requires the validity of each new constitutional
Amendment to be judged on its own merits. The actual effect and
impact of the law on the rights guaranteed under Part III has to be
taken into account for determining whether or not it destroys basic
structure. The impact test would determine the validity of the
challenge.
3.  All amendments to the Constitution made on or after 24th April,
1973 by which the Ninth Schedule is amended by inclusion of various
laws therein shall have to be tested on the touchstone of the basic or
essential features of the Constitution as reflected in Article 21 read
with Articles 14 and 19 and the principles underlying them. To put it
differently, even though an act is put in the Ninth Schedule by a
Constitutional Amendment, its provisions would be open to attack on
the ground that they destroy or damage the basic structure if the
Fundamental Right or rights taken away or abrogated pertains or
pertain to the basic structure.
4.  Justification for conferring protection, not blanket protection, on the
laws included in the Ninth Schedule by Constitutional Amendments
shall be a matter of constitutional adjudication by examining the nature
and extent of infraction of a Fundamental Right by a statute, sought to
be constitutionally protected, and on the touchstone of the basic
structure doctrine as reflected in Article 21 read with Articles 14 and
19 by application of the “rights test” and the “essence of the right” test
taking the synoptic view of the articles in Part III as held in the Indira
Gandhi Case.16 Applying the above test to the Ninth Schedule laws, if
the infraction affects the basic structure, then such a law or laws will
not get the protection of the Ninth Schedule. When the triangle of
Article 21 read with Article 14 and Article 19 is sought to be
eliminated not only the “essence of the right” test but also the “rights
test” has to apply. There is also a difference between the “rights test”
and the “essence of the right” test. Both form part of application of the
basic structure doctrine. When in a controlled constitution conferring
limited power of amendment, an entire chapter is made in applicable,
the “essence of the right” test as applied in Nagaraj case17 will have no
applicability. In such a situation, to judge the validity of the law, it is
the “rights test” which is more appropriate.
5.  If the validity of any Ninth Schedule law has already been upheld
by this Court, it would not be open to challenge such law again on the
principles declared by this judgment. However, if a law held to be
violative of any rights in Part III is subsequently incorporated in the
Ninth Schedule after 24th April, 1973, such a violation / infraction shall
be open to challenge on the ground that it destroys or damages the
basic structure as indicated in Article 21 read with Articles 14 and 19
and the principles underlying them.
6.  Action taken and transactions finalized as a result of the impugned
Acts shall not be open to challenge.

28 Judicial Activism
The concept of judicial activism originated and developed in the USA.
This term was first coined in 1947 by Arthur Schlesinger Jr., an American
historian and educator.
1
In India, the doctrine of judicial activism was introduced in mid-1970s.
Justice V.R. Krishna Iyer, Justice P.N. Bhagwati, Justice O. Chinnappa
Reddy and Justice D.A. Desai laid the foundations of judicial activism in
the country.
MEANING OF JUDICIAL ACTIVISM
Judicial activism denotes the proactive role played by the judiciary in the
protection of the rights of citizens and in the promotion of justice in the
society. In other words, it implies the assertive role played by the judiciary
to force the other two organs of the government (legislature and executive)
to discharge their constitutional duties.
Judicial activism is also known as “judicial dynamism”. It is the
antithesis of “judicial restraint”, which means the self-control exercised by
the judiciary.
Judicial activism is defined in the following way:
1.  “Judicial activism is a way of exercising judicial power that
motivates judges to depart from normally practised strict adherence to
judicial precedent in favour of progressive and new social policies. It
is commonly marked by decision calling for social engineering, and
occasionally these decisions represent intrusion in the legislative and
executive matters”.2
2.  “Judicial activism is the practice in the judiciary of protecting or
expanding individual rights through decisions that depart from
established precedent, or are independent of, or in opposition to
supposed constitutional or legislation intent”.3
3.  “Judicial activism can be defined as the process of law-making by
judges. It means an active interpretation of existing legislation by a
judge, made with a view to enhance the utility of that legislation for
social betterment. Judicial activism is different from judicial
pessimism which means interpretation of existing provisions of law,
without an attempt to enhance its beneficial aspects”.3a
4.  “Judicial activism is a philosophy of judicial decision-making
whereby judges allow their personal views about public policy, among
other factors, to guide their decisions”.3b
5.  “Judicial activism is a procedure to evolve new principles,
concepts, maxims, formulae and relief to do justice or to expand the
standing of the litigant and open the door of courts for needy or to
entertain litigation affecting the entire society or a section of it”.3c
The concept of judicial activism is closely related to the concept of
Public Interest Litigation (PIL). It is the judicial activism of the Supreme
Court which is the major factor for the rise of PIL. In other words, PIL is an
outcome of judicial activism. In fact, PIL is the most popular form (or
manifestation) of judicial activism.
JUDICIAL REVIEW AND JUDICIAL ACTIVISM
The concepts of judicial review and judicial activism are closely related to
each other. But, there is a difference between them. The following points
bring out this difference:
1.  Since about the mid-20th century, a version of judicial review has
acquired the nick-name of judicial activism, especially in the USA. In
India, the participants in the debate mix up judicial activism with
judicial review. The former is that form of latter in which judges
participate in law-making policies, i.e., not only they uphold or
invalidate laws in terms of constitutional provisions, but also exercise
their policy preferences in doing so.3d
2.  The concept of judicial activism is inherent in judicial review,
which empowers the court to uphold the constitution and declare the
laws and action inconsistent with the constitution as void. Judicial
activism is necessary for ensuring proper discharge of duties by other
organs.3e
3.  The term “judicial activism” came into currency some time in the
twentieth century to describe the act of judicial legislation i.e., judges
making positive law. However, there is no standard definition of the
term “judicial activism”. As a whole it can be said that judicial
activism stresses the importance of judicial review and a powerful
judiciary in the protection and promotion of certain core rights.3f
4.  The expanded concept of locus standi in connection with PIL, by
judicial interpretation from time-to-time, has expanded the
jurisdictional limits of the courts exercising judicial review. This
expanded role has been given the title of “judicial activism” by those
who are critical of this expanded role of the judiciary.
3g
5.  Judicial activism, as regards constitutional cases, falls under the
rubric of what is commonly called judicial review, and at the broadest
level, it is any occasion where a court intervenes and strikes down a
piece of duly enacted legislation.3h
JUSTIFICATION OF JUDICIAL ACTIVISM
According to Dr. B.L. Wadehra, the reasons for judicial activism are as
follows:4
(i) There is near collapse of the responsible government, when the
Legislature and Executive fail to discharge their respective
functions. This results in erosion of the confidence in the
Constitution and democracy amongst the citizens.
(ii) The citizens of the country look up to the judiciary for the
protection of their rights and freedoms. This leads to tremendous
pressure on judiciary to step in aid for the suffering masses.
(iii) Judicial Enthusiasm, that is, the judges like to participate in the
social reforms that take place in the changing times. It encourages
the Public Interest Litigation and liberalises the principle of
‘Locus Standi’.
(iv) Legislative Vacuum, that is, there may be certain areas, which
have not been legislated upon. It is therefore, upon court to
indulge in judicial legislation and to meet the changing social
needs.
(v) The Constitution of India has itself adopted certain provisions,
which gives judiciary enough scope to legislate or to play an
active role.
Similarly, Subhash Kashyap observes that certain eventualities may be
conceived when the judiciary may have to overstep its normal jurisdiction
and intervene in areas otherwise falling within the domain of the legislature
and the executive:5
(i) When the legislature fails to discharge its responsibilities.
(ii) In case of a ‘hung’ legislature when the government it provides is
weak, insecure and busy only in the struggle for survival and,
therefore, unable to take any decision which displeases any caste,
community, or other group.
(iii) Those in power may be afraid of taking honest and hard decisions
for fear of losing power and, for that reason, may have public
issues referred to courts as issues of law in order to mark time and
delay decisions or to pass on the odium of strong decision-making
to the courts.
(iv) Where the legislature and the executive fail to protect the basic
rights of citizens, like the right to live a decent life, healthy
surroundings, or to provide honest, efficient and just system of
laws and administration.
(v) Where the court of law is misused by a strong authoritarian
parliamentary party government for ulterior motives, as was
sought to be done during the emergency aberration.
(vi) Sometimes, the courts themselves knowingly or unknowingly
become victims of human, all too human, weaknesses of craze for
populism, publicity, playing to the media and hogging the
headlines.
According to Dr. Vandana, the concept of judicial activism can be seen to
be reflecting from the following trends, namely:5a
(i) Expansion of rights of hearing in the administrative process.
(ii) Excessive delegation without limitation.
(iii) Expansion of judicial control over discretionary powers.
(iv) Expansion of judicial review over the administration.
(v) Promotion of open government.
(vi) Indiscriminate exercise of contempt power.
(vii) Exercise of jurisdiction when non-exist.
(viii) Over extending the standard rules of interpretation in its search
to achieve economic, social and educational objectives.
(ix) Passing of orders which are per se unworkable.
ACTIVATORS OF JUDICIAL ACTIVISM
Upendra Baxi, an eminent jurist, has delineated the following typology of
social / human rights activists who activated judicial activism6
 :
1.  Civil Rights Activists: These groups primarily focus on civil and
political rights issues.
2.  People Rights Activists: These groups focus on social and
economic rights within the contexts of state repression of people’s
movements.
3.  Consumer Rights Groups: These formations raise issues of
consumer rights within the framework of accountability of the polity
and the economy.
4.  Bonded Labour Groups: These groups ask for judicial activism is
nothing short of annihilation of wage slavery in India.
5.  Citizens for Environmental Action: These groups activate an
activist judiciary to combat increasing environmental degradation and
pollution.
6.  Citizen Groups against Large Irrigation Projects: These activist
formations ask the Indian judiciary the impossible for any judiciary in
the world, namely, cease to and desist from ordering against mega
irrigation projects.
7.  Rights of Child Groups: These groups focus on child labour, the
right to literacy, juveniles in custodial institutions and rights of
children born to sex workers.
8.  Custodial Rights Groups: These groups include social action by
prisoners’ rights groups, women under state ‘protective’ custody and
persons under preventive detention.
9.  Poverty Rights Groups: These groups litigate issues concerning
draught and famine relief and urban impoverished.
10.  Indigenous People’s Rights Groups: These groups agitate for
issues of forest dwellers, citizens of the Fifth and Sixth Schedules of
the Indian Constitution and identity rights.
11.  Women’s Rights Groups: These groups agitate for issues of
gender equality, gender-based violence and harassment, rape and
dowry murders.
12.  Bar-based Groups: These associations agitate for issues
concerning autonomy and accountability of the Indian judiciary.
13.  Media Autonomy Groups: These groups focus on the autonomy
and accountability of the press and instruments of mass media owned
by the State.
14.  Assorted Lawyer-Based Groups: This category includes the
critically influential lawyers’ groups which agitate for various causes.
15.  Assorted Individual Petitioners: This category includes
freelance activist individuals.
APPREHENSIONS OF JUDICIAL ACTIVISM
The same jurist Upendra Baxi also presented a typology of fears which are
generated by judicial activism. He observes: “The facts entail invocation of
a wide range of fears. The invocation is designed to bring into a nervous
rationality among India’s most conscientious justices”. He described the
following types of fears7
 :
1.  Ideological fears: (Are they usurping powers of the legislature, the
executive or of other autonomous institutions in a civil society?)
2.  Epistemic fears: (Do they have enough knowledge in economic
matters of a Manmohan Singh, in scientific matters of the Czars of the
atomic energy establishment, the captains of the Council of Scientific
and Industrial Research, and so on?)
3.  Management fears: (Are they doing justice by adding this kind of
litigation work load to a situation of staggering growth of arrears?)
4.  Legitimation fears: (Are not they causing depletion of their
symbolic and instrumental authority by passing orders in public
interest litigation which the executive may bypass or ignore? Would
not the people’s faith in judiciary, a democratic recourse, be thus
eroded?)
5.  Democratic fears: (Is a profusion of public interest litigation
nurturing democracy or depleting its potential for the future?)
6.  Biographic fears: (What would be my place in national affairs
after superannuation if I overdo this kind of litigation?)
JUDICIAL ACTIVISM VS. JUDICIAL RESTRAINT
Meaning of Judicial Restraint
Judicial activism and judicial restraint are the two alternative judicial
philosophies in the United States. Those who subscribe to judicial restraint
contend that the role of judges should be scrupulously limited; their job is
merely to say what the law is, leaving the business of lawmaking where it
properly belongs, that is, with the legislators and the executives. Under no
circumstances, moreover, should judges allow their personal political values
and policy agendas to colour their judicial opinions. This view holds that
the ‘original intent’ of the authors of the constitution and its amendments is
knowable, and must guide the courts.8
Assumptions of Judicial Restraint
In the USA, the doctrine of judicial restraint is based on the following six
assumptions9
 :
1.  The Court is basically undemocratic because it is non-elective and
presumably non-responsive to the popular will. Because of its alleged
oligarchic composition the court should defer wherever possible to the
‘more’ democratic branches of government.
2.  The questionable origins of the great power of judicial review, a
power not specifically granted by the Constitution.
3.  The doctrine of separation of powers.
4.  The concept of federalism, dividing powers between the nation and
the states requires of the Court deference toward the action of state
governments and officials.
5.  The non-ideological but pragmatic assumption that since the Court
is dependent on the Congress for its jurisdiction and resources, and
dependent on public acceptance for its effectiveness, it ought not to
overstep its boundaries without consideration of the risks involved.
6.  The aristocratic notion that, being a court of law, and inheritor and
custodian of the Anglo-American legal tradition, it ought not to go too
far to the level of politics–law being the process of reason and
judgment and politics being concerned only with power and influence.
From the above, it is clear that all the assumptions (except the second
dealing with the judicial review) hold good in the Indian context too.
Supreme Court Observations
While delivering a judgement in December 2007, the Supreme Court of
India called for judicial restraint and asked courts not to take over the
functions of the legislature or the executive, saying there is a broad
separation of powers under the Constitution and each organ of the state
must have respect for others and should not encroach on others’ domain. In
this context, the concerned Bench of the court made the following
observations10
 :
1.  The Bench said, “We are repeatedly coming across cases where
judges are unjustifiably trying to perform executive or legislative
functions. This is clearly unconstitutional. In the name of judicial
activism, judges cannot cross their limits and try to take over functions
which belong to another organ of the state”.
2.  The Bench said, “Judges must know their limits and must not try to
run the government. They must have modesty and humility, and not
behave like emperors.”
3.  Quoting from the book ‘The Spirit of Laws’ by Montesquieu on the
consequences of not maintaining separation of powers among the three
organs, the Bench said the French political philosopher’s “warning is
particularly apt and timely for the Indian judiciary today, since very
often it is rightly criticised for ‘overreach’ and encroachment on the
domain of the other two organs.”
4.  Judicial activism must not become judicial adventurism, the Bench
warned the courts Adjudication must be done within the system of
historically validated restraints and conscious minimisation of judges’
preferences.
5.  “The courts must not embarrass administrative authorities and must
realise that administrative authorities have expertise in the field of
administration while the court does not.”
6.  The Bench said, “The justification often given for judicial
encroachment on the domain of the executive or the legislature is that
the other two organs are not doing their jobs properly. Even assuming
this is so, the same allegations can be made against the judiciary too
because there are cases pending in courts for half-a-century.”
7.  If the legislature or the executive was not functioning properly, it
was for the people to correct the defects by exercising their franchise
properly in the next elections and voting for candidates who would
fulfil their expectations or by other lawful methods, e.g., peaceful
demonstrations.
8.  “The remedy is not in the judiciary taking over the legislative or the
executive functions, because that will not only violate the delicate
balance of power enshrined in the Constitution but also (because) the
judiciary has neither the expertise nor the resources to perform these
functions.”
9.  The Bench said: “Judicial restraint is consistent with and
complementary to the balance of power among the three independent
branches of the state. It accomplishes this in two ways: first, judicial
restraint not only recognises the equality of the other two branches
with the judiciary, it also fosters that equality by minimising interbranch interference by the judiciary. Second, judicial restraint tends to
protect the independence of the judiciary. When courts encroach on the
legislative or administrative fields almost inevitably voters, legislators,
and other elected officials will conclude that the activities of judges
should be closely monitored.

29 Public Interest Litigation
The concept of Public Interest Litigation (PIL) originated and developed
in the USA in the 1960s. In the USA, it was designed to provide legal
representation to previously unrepresented groups and interests. It was
undertaken in recognition of the fact that the ordinary marketplace for legal
services fails to provide such services to significant segments of the
population and to significant interests. Such groups and interests include the
poor, environmentalists, consumers, racial and ethnic minorities, and
others.1
In India, the PIL is a product of the judicial activism role of the Supreme
Court. It was introduced in the early 1980s. Justice V.R. Krishna Iyer and
Justice P.N. Bhagwati were the pioneers of the concept of PIL.
PIL is also known variously as Social Action Litigation (SAL), Social
Interest Litigation (SIL) and Class Action Litigation (CAL).
MEANING OF PIL
The introduction of PIL in India was facilitated by the relaxation of the
traditional rule of ‘locus standi’. According to this rule, only that person
whose rights are infringed alone can move the court for the remedies,
whereas, the PIL is an exception to this traditional rule. Under the PIL, any
public-spirited citizen or a social organisation can move the court for the
enforcement of the rights of any person or group of persons who because of
their poverty or ignorance or socially or economically disadvantaged
position are themselves unable to approach the court for the remedies. Thus,
in a PIL, any member of the public having ‘sufficient interest’ can approach
the court for enforcing the rights of other persons and redressal of a
common grievance.
The Supreme Court has defined the PIL as “a legal action initiated in a
court of law for the enforcement of public interest or general interest in
which the public or a class of the community have pecuniary interest or
some interest by which their legal rights or liabilities are affected.”2
PIL is absolutely necessary for maintaining the rule of law, furthering the
cause of justice and accelerating the pace of realisation of the constitutional
objectives. In other words, the real purposes of PIL are:
(i) vindication of the rule of law,
(ii) facilitating effective access to justice to the socially and
economically weaker sections of the society, and
(iii) meaningful realisation of the fundamental rights.
FEATURES OF PIL
The various features of the PIL are explained below:
1.  PIL is a strategic arm of the legal aid movement and is intended to
bring justice within the reach of the poor masses, who constitute the
low visibility area of humanity.
2.  PIL is a totally different kind of litigation from the ordinary
traditional litigation which is essentially of an adversary character
where there is a dispute between two litigating parties, one making
claims seeking relief against the other and that other opposing such
claim or resisting such relief.
3.  PIL is brought before the Court not for the purpose of enforcing the
right of one individual against another as happens in the case of
ordinary litigation, but it is intended to promote and vindicate public
interest.
4.  PIL demands that violations of constitutional and legal rights of
large numbers of people who are poor, ignorant or in a socially or
economically disadvantaged position should not go unnoticed and
unredressed.
5.  PIL is essentially a co-operative effort on the part of the petitioner,
the State or Public Authority, and the Court to secure observance of the
constitutional or legal rights, benefits and privileges conferred upon
the vulnerable sections of the community and to reach social justice to
them.
6.  In PIL, litigation is undertaken for the purpose of redressing public
injury, enforcing public duty, protecting social, collective, diffused
rights and interests or vindicating public interest.
7.  In PIL, the role held by the Court is more assertive than in
traditional actions; it is creative rather than passive and it assumes a
more positive attitude in determining acts.
8.  Though in PIL court enjoys a degree of flexibility unknown to the
trial of traditional private law litigations, whatever the procedure
adopted by the court it must be procedure known to judicial tenets and
characteristics of a judicial proceeding.
9.  In a PIL, unlike traditional dispute resolution mechanism, there is
no determination on adjudication of individual rights.
SCOPE OF PIL
In 1998, the Supreme Court formulated a set of guidelines to be followed
for entertaining letters or petitions received by it as PIL. These guidelines
were modified in 1993 and 2003. According to them, the letters or petitions
falling under the following categories alone will ordinarily be entertained as
PIL:
1.  Bonded labour matters
2.  Neglected children
3.  Non-payment of minimum wages to workers and exploitation of
casual workers and complaints of violation of Labour Laws (except in
individual cases)
4.  Petitions from jails complaining of harassment, for pre-mature
release and seeking release after having completed 14 years in jail,
death in jail, transfer, release on personal bond, speedy trial as a
fundamental right
5.  Petitions against police for refusing to register a case, harassment
by police and death in police custody
6.  Petitions against atrocities on women, in particular harassment of
bride, brideburning, rape, murder, kidnapping, etc.
7.  Petitions complaining of harassment or torture of villagers by covillagers or by police from persons belonging to Scheduled Caste and
Scheduled Tribes and economically backward classes
8.  Petitions pertaining to environmental pollution, disturbance of
ecological balance, drugs, food adulteration, maintenance of heritage
and culture, antiques, forest and wild life and other matters of public
importance
9.  Petitions from riot-victims
10.  Family pension
The cases falling under the following categories will not be entertained as
PIL:
1.  Landlord-tenant matters
2.  Service matter and those pertaining to pension and gratuity
3.  Complaints against Central/ State Government departments and
Local Bodies except those relating to item numbers (1) to (10) above
4.  Admission to medical and other educational institution
5.  Petitions for early hearing of cases pending in High Courts and
Subordinate Courts
PRINCIPLES OF PIL
The Supreme Court evolved the following principles in regard to PIL3
 :
1.  The Court in exercise of powers under Articles 32 and 226 of the
Constitution can entertain a petition filed by any interested person in
the welfare of the people who are in a disadvantaged position and thus
not in a position to knock the doors of the Court. The Court is
constitutionally bound to protect the Fundamental Rights of such
disadvantaged people and direct the State to fulfil its constitutional
promises.
2.  When the issues of public importance, enforcement of the
fundamental rights of large number of people vis-a-vis the
constitutional duties and functions of the State are raised, the court
treat a letter or a telegram as a PIL. In such cases, the court relaxes the
procedural laws and also the law relating to pleadings.
3.  Whenever injustice is meted out to a large number of people, the
court will not hesitate to step in to invoke Articles 14 and 21 of the
Constitution of India as well as the International Conventions on
Human Rights which provide for a reasonable and fair trial.
4.  The common rule of locus standi is relaxed so as to enable the court
to look into the grievances complained on behalf of the poor, deprived,
illiterate and the disabled who cannot vindicate the legal wrong or
legal injury caused to them for violation of any constitutional or legal
right.
5.  When the Court is prima facie satisfied about violation of any
constitutional right of a group of people belonging to the
disadvantaged category, it may not allow the State or the Government
from raising the question as to the maintainability of the petition.
6.  Although procedural laws apply on PIL cases, the question as to
whether the principles of res judicata4 or principles analogous thereto
would apply depend on the nature of the petition and also facts and
circumstances of the case.
7.  The dispute between two warring groups purely in the realm of
private law would not be allowed to be agitated as a PIL.
8.  However, in an appropriate case, although the petitioner might have
moved a Court in his private interest and for redressal of the personal
grievances, the Court in furtherance of the public interest may treat it
necessary to enquire into the state of affairs of the subject of litigation
in the interest of justice.
9.  The Court in special situations may appoint Commission or other
bodies for the purpose of investigating into the allegations and finding
out facts. It may also direct management of a public institution taken
over by such Commission.
10.  The Court will not ordinarily transgress into a policy. It shall also
take utmost care not to transgress its jurisdiction while purporting to
protect the rights of the people from being violated.
11.  The Court would ordinarily not step out of the known areas of
judicial review. The High Court although may pass an order for doing
complete justice to the parties, it does not have a power akin to Article
142 of the Constitution of India.
12.  Ordinarily the High Court should not entertain a writ petition by
way of PIL questioning constitutionality or validity of a statute or a
statutory rule.
GUIDELINES FOR ADMITTING PIL
The PIL has now come to occupy an important field in the administration of
law. It should not be allowed to become ‘Publicity Interest Litigation’ or
‘Politics Interest Litigation’ or ‘Private Interest Litigation’ or ‘Paisa Interest
Litigation’ or ‘Middle-class Interest Litigation’ (MIL).
The Supreme Court, in this context, observed: “PIL is not a pill or a
panacea for all wrongs. It was essentially meant to protect basic human
rights of the weak and the disadvantaged and was a procedure which was
innovated where a public-spirited person files a petition in effect on behalf
of such persons who on account of poverty, helplessness or economic and
social disabilities could not approach the court for relief. There have been,
in recent times increasingly instances of abuse of PIL. Therefore, there is a
need to re-emphasise the parameters within which PIL can be resorted to by
a petitioner and entertained by the court.”5
Therefore, the Supreme Court laid down the following guidelines for
checking the misuse of the PIL6
 :
1.  The court must encourage genuine and bona fide PIL and
effectively discourage and curb the PIL field for extraneous
considerations.
2.  Instead of every individual Judge devising his own procedure for
dealing with PIL, it would be appropriate for each High Court to
properly formulate rules for encouraging the genuine PIL filed and
discouraging PIL filed with oblique motives.
3.  The Court should prima facie verify the credentials of the petitioner
before entertaining the PIL.
4.  The Court shall be prima facie satisfied regarding the correctness of
the contents of petition before entertaining the PIL.
5.  The Court should be fully satisfied that substantial public interest is
involved before entertaining the petition.
6.  The Court should ensure that the petition which involves larger
public interest, gravity and urgency must be given priority over other
petitions.
7.  The Court before entertaining the PIL must ensure that the PIL is
aimed at redressal of genuine public harm and public injury. The Court
should also ensure that there is no personal gain, private motive or
oblique motive behind filing PIL.
8.  The Court should also ensure that the petition filed by busybodies
for extraneous and ulterior motives must be discouraged by imposing
exemplary costs or adopting similar novel methods to curb frivolous
petitions and the petitions filed for extraneous considerations.

STATE GOVERNMENT
30. Governor
31. Chief Minister

33. State Legislature
34. High Court
35. Tribunals
36. Subordinate Courts

30 Governor
The Constitution of India envisages the same pattern of government in the
states as that for the Centre, that is, a parliamentary system. Part VI of the
Constitution deals with the government in the states.
Articles 153 to 167 in Part VI of the Constitution deal with the state
executive. The state executive consists of the governor, the chief minister,
the council of ministers and the advocate general of the state. Thus, there is
no office of vice-governor (in the state) like that of Vice-President at the
Centre.
The governor is the chief executive head of the state. But, like the
president, he is a nominal executive head (titular or constitutional head).
The governor also acts as an agent of the central government. Therefore, the
office of governor has a dual role.
Usually, there is a governor for each state, but the 7th Constitutional
Amendment Act of 1956 facilitated the appointment of the same person as a
governor for two or more states.
APPOINTMENT OF GOVERNOR
The governor is neither directly elected by the people nor indirectly elected
by a specially constituted electoral college as is the case with the president.
He is appointed by the president by warrant under his hand and seal. In a
way, he is a nominee of the Central government. But, as held by the
Supreme Court in 1979, the office of governor of a state is not an
employment under the Central government. It is an independent
constitutional office and is not under the control of or subordinate to the
Central government.
The Draft Constitution provided for the direct election of the governor on
the basis of universal adult suffrage. But the Constituent Assembly opted
for the present system of appointment of governor by the president because
of the following reasons1
 :
1.  The direct election of the governor is incompatible with the
parliamentary system established in the states.
2.  The mode of direct election is more likely to create conflicts
between the governor and the chief minister.
3.  The governor being only a constitutional (nominal) head, there is
no point in making elaborate arrangements for his election and
spending huge amount of money.
4.  The election of a governor would be entirely on personal issues.
Hence, it is not in the national interest to involve a large number of
voters in such an election.
5.  An elected governor would naturally belong to a party and would
not be a neutral person and an impartial head.
6.  The election of governor would create separatist tendencies and
thus affect the political stability and unity of the country.
7.  The system of presidential nomination enables the Centre to
maintain its control over the states.
8.  The direct election of the governor creates a serious problem of
leadership at the time of a general election in the state.
9.  The chief minister would like his nominee to contest for
governorship. Hence, a second rate man of the ruling party is elected
as governor.
Therefore, the American model, where the Governor of a state is directly
elected, was dropped and the Canadian model, where the governor of a
province (state) is appointed by the Governor-General (Centre), was
accepted in the Constituent Assembly.
The Constitution lays down only two qualifications for the appointment
of a person as a governor. These are:
1.  He should be a citizen of India.
2.  He should have completed the age of 35 years.
Additionally, two conventions have also developed in this regard over the
years. First, he should be an outsider, that is, he should not belong to the
state where he is appointed, so that he is free from the local politics.
Second, while appointing the governor, the president is required to consult
the chief minister of the state concerned, so that the smooth functioning of
the constitutional machinery in the state is ensured. However, both the
conventions have been violated in some of the cases.
CONDITIONS OF GOVERNOR’S OFFICE
The Constitution lays down the following conditions for the the governor’s
office:
1.  He should not be a member of either House of Parliament or a
House of the state legislature. If any such person is appointed as
governor, he is deemed to have vacated his seat in that House on the
date on which he enters upon his office as the governor.
2.  He should not hold any other office of profit.
3.  He is entitled without payment of rent to the use of his official
residence (the Raj Bhavan).
4.  He is entitled to such emoluments, allowances and privileges as
may be determined by Parliament.
5.  When the same person is appointed as the governor of two or more
states, the emoluments and allowances payable to him are shared by
the states in such proportion as determined by the president.
6.  His emoluments and allowances cannot be diminished during his
term of office.
In 2018, the Parliament has increased the salary of the governor from
₹1.10 lakh to ₹3.50 lakh per month.2
Like the President, the governor is also entitled to a number of privileges
and immunities. He enjoys personal immunity from legal liability for his
official acts. During his term of office, he is immune from any criminal
proceedings, even in respect of his personal acts. He cannot be arrested or
imprisoned. However, after giving two months’ notice, civil proceedings
can be instituted against him during his term of office in respect of his
personal acts.
Before entering upon his office, the governor has to make and subscribe
to an oath or affirmation. In his oath, the governor swears:
(a)  to faithfully execute the office;
(b)  to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution and the law; and
(c)  to devote himself to the service and well-being of the people of the
state.
The oath of office to the governor is administered by the chief justice of
the concerned state high court and in his absence, the senior-most judge of
that court available.
Every person discharging the functions of the governor also undertakes
the similar oath or affirmation.
TERM OF GOVERNOR’S OFFICE
A governor holds office for a term of five years from the date on which he
enters upon his office. However, this term of five years is subject to the
pleasure of the President. Further, he can resign at any time by addressing a
resignation letter to the President.
The Supreme Court held that the pleasure of the President is not
justifiable. The governor has no security of tenure and no fixed term of
office. He may be removed by the President at any time.3
The Constitution does not lay down any grounds upon which a governor
may be removed by the President. Hence, the National Front Government
headed by V.P. Singh (1989) asked all the governors to resign as they were
appointed by the Congress government. Eventually, some of the governors
were replaced and some were allowed to continue. The same thing was
repeated in 1991, when the Congress Government headed by P.V.
Narasimha Rao changed fourteen governors appointed by the V.P. Singh
and Chandra Sekhar governments.
The President may transfer a Governor appointed to one state to another
state for the rest of the term. Further, a Governor whose term has expired
may be reappointed in the same state or any other state.
A governor can hold office beyond his term of five years until his
successor assumes charge. The underlying idea is that there must be a
governor in the state and there cannot be an interregnum.
The President can make such provision as he thinks fit for the discharge
of the functions of the governor in any contingency not provided for in the
Constitution, for example, the death of a sitting governor. Thus, the chief
justice of the concerned state high court may be appointed temporarily to
discharge the functions of the governor of that state.
POWERS AND FUNCTIONS OF GOVERNOR
A governor possesses executive, legislative, financial and judicial powers
more or less analogous to the President of India. However, he has no
diplomatic, military or emergency powers like the president.
The powers and functions of the governor can be studied under the
following heads:
1.  Executive powers.
2.  Legislative powers.
3.  Financial powers.
4.  Judicial powers.
Executive Powers
The executive powers and functions of the Governor are:
1.  All executive actions of the government of a state are formally
taken in his name.
2.  He can make rules specifying the manner in which the Orders and
other instruments made and executed in his name shall be
authenticated.
3.  He can make rules for more convenient transaction of the business
of a state government and for the allocation among the ministers of the
said business.
4.  He appoints the chief minister and other ministers. They also hold
office during his pleasure. There should be a Tribal Welfare minister in
the states of Chattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh and Odisha
appointed by him. The state of Bihar was excluded from this provision
by the 94th
 Amendment Act of 2006.
5.  He appoints the advocate general of a state and determines his
remuneration. The advocate general holds office during the pleasure of
the governor.
6.  He appoints the state election commissioner and determines his
conditions of service and tenure of office. However, the state election
commissioner can be removed only in like manner and on the like
grounds as a judge of a high court.
7.  He appoints the chairman and members of the state public service
commission. However, they can be removed only by the president and
not by a governor.
8.  He can seek any information relating to the administration of the
affairs of the state and proposals for legislation from the chief minister.
9.  He can require the chief minister to submit for the consideration of
the council of ministers any matter on which a decision has been taken
by a minister but which has not been considered by the council.
10.  He can recommend the imposition of constitutional emergency in
a state to the president. During the period of President’s rule in a state,
the governor enjoys extensive executive powers as an agent of the
President.
11.  He acts as the chancellor of universities in the state. He also
appoints the vicechancellors of universities in the state.
Legislative Powers
A governor is an integral part of the state legislature. In that capacity, he has
the following legislative powers and functions:
1.  He can summon or prorogue the state legislature and dissolve the
state legislative assembly.
2.  He can address the state legislature at the commencement of the
first session after each general election and the first session of each
year.
3.  He can send messages to the house or houses of the state
legislature, with respect to a bill pending in the legislature or
otherwise.
4.  He can appoint any member of the State legislative assembly to
preside over its proceedings when the offices of both the Speaker and
the Deputy Speaker fall vacant. Similarly, he can appoint any member
of the state legislature council to preside over its proceedings when the
offices of both Chairman and Deputy Chairman fall vacant.
5.  He nominates one-sixth of the members of the state legislative
council from amongst persons having special knowledge or practical
experience in literature, science, art, cooperative movement and social
service.
6.  He can nominate one member to the state legislature assembly from
the Anglo-Indian Community.
7.  He decides on the question of disqualification of members of the
state legislature in consultation with the Election Commission.
8.  When a bill is sent to the governor after it is passed by state
legislature, he can:
(a)  Give his assent to the bill, or
(b)  Withhold his assent to the bill, or
(c)  Return the bill (if it is not a money bill) for reconsideration of the
state legislature. However, if the bill is passed again by the state
legislature with or without amendments, the governor has to give his
assent to the bill, or
(d)  Reserve the bill for the consideration of the president. In one case
such reservation is obligatory, that is, where the bill passed by the state
legislature endangers the position of the state high court. In addition,
the governor can also reserve the bill if it is of the following nature:4
(i) Ultra-vires, that is, against the provisions of the
Constitution.
(ii) Opposed to the Directive Principles of State
Policy.
(iii) Against the larger interest of the country.
(iv) Of grave national importance.
(v) Dealing with compulsory acquisition of property
under Article 31A of the Constitution.
9.  He can promulgate ordinances when the state legislature is not in
session. These ordinances must be approved by the state legislature
within six weeks from its reassembly. He can also withdraw an
ordinance anytime. This is the most important legislative power of the
governor.
10.  He lays the reports of the State Finance Commission, the State
Public Service Commission and the Comptroller and Auditor-General
relating to the accounts of the state, before the state legislature.
Financial Powers
The financial powers and functions of the governor are:
1.  He sees that the Annual Financial Statement (state budget) is laid
before the state legislature.
2.  Money bills can be introduced in the state legislature only with his
prior recommendation.
3.  No demand for a grant can be made except on his recommendation.
4.  He can make advances out of the Contingency Fund of the state to
meet any unforeseen expenditure.
5.  He constitutes a finance commission after every five years to
review the financial position of the panchayats and the municipalities.
Judicial Powers
The judicial powers and functions of the governor are:
1.  He can grant pardons, reprives, respites and remissions of
punishment or suspend, remit and commute the sentence of any person
convicted of any offence against any law relating to a matter to which
the executive power of the state extends.5
2.  He is consulted by the president while appointing the judges of the
concerned state high court.
3.  He makes appointments, postings and promotions of the district
judges in consultation with the state high court.
4.  He also appoints persons to the judicial service of the state (other
than district judges) in consultation with the state high court and the
State Public Service Commission.
Now, we will study in detail the three important powers of the governor
(veto power, ordinance-making power and pardoning power) by comparing
them with that of the President.

2.  He may withhold his assent to the
bill, the bill then ends and does
not become an act.
3.   He may return the bill for
reconsideration of the Houses. If
the bill is passed by both the
Houses again with or without
amendments and presented to the
President for his assent, the
president must give his assent to
the bill. Thus the president
enjoys only a ‘suspensive veto’.

4.   He may reserve the bill for the

When a state bill is reserved by the
governor for the consideration of the
President, the President has three
alternatives:

(b)  He may withhold his assent
to the bill, the bill then ends and
does not become an Act.
(c)  He may return the bill for
reconsideration of the House or

When a bill is so returned, the
House or Houses have to
reconsider it within six months.
If the bill is passed by the
When the governor reserves a bill for
the consideration of the President, he
will not have any further role in the
enactment of the bill. If the bill is
returned by the President for the
reconsideration of the House or
Houses and is passed again, the bill
must be presented again for the
presidential assent only. If the
President gives his assent to the bill,
it becomes an act. This means that
the assent of the Governor is no
longer required. 
House or Houses again with or
without amendments and
presented to the president for
his assent, the president is not
bound to give his assent to the
bill. He may give his assent to
such a bill or withhold his
assent.
Every money bill after it is passed
by the Parliament, is presented to the
President for his assent. He has two
alternatives:
1.  He may give his assent to the bill,
the bill then becomes an act.
2.   He may withhold his assent to
the bill, the bill then ends and
does not become an act.
Every money bill, after it is passed
by the state legislature (unicameral or
bicameral), is presented to the
governor for his assent. He has three
alternatives:

the bill then becomes an act.
2.  He may withhold his assent to the
bill, the bill then ends and does
not become an act.
3.   He may reserve the bill for the
consideration of the president.
Thus, the President cannot return a
money bill for the reconsideration of
the Parliament. Normally, the
president gives his assent to a money
bill as it is introduced in the
Parliament with his previous
permission.
When a Money Bill is reserved by
the Governor for the consideration
of the President, the President has
two alternatives:
(a)  He may give his assent to
the bill, the bill then becomes
an Act.
Thus, the governor cannot return a
money bill for the reconsideration of
the state legislature. Normally, the
governor gives his assent to a money
bill as it is introduced in the state
legislature with his previous
permission.
When the governor reserves a money
bill for the consideration of the
President, he will not have any
further role in the enactment of the
bill. If the President gives his assent
to the bill, it becomes an Act. This
means that the assent of the governor
is no longer required.
(b)  He may withhold his assent
to the bill, the bill then ends and
does not become an act.
Thus, the President cannot return a
money bill for the reconsideration of
the state legislature (as in the case of
the Parliament).

CONSTITUTIONAL POSITION OF GOVERNOR
The Constitution of India provides for a parliamentary form of government
in the states as in the Centre. Consequently, the governor has been made
only a nominal executive, the real executive constitutes the council of
ministers headed by the chief minister. In other words, the governor has to
exercise his powers and functions with the aid and advise of the council of
ministers headed by the chief minister, except in matters in which he is
required to act in his discretion (i.e., without the advice of ministers).
In estimating the constitutional position of the governor, particular
reference has to be made to the provisions of Articles 154, 163 and 164.
These are:
(a)  The executive power of the state shall be vested in the governor
and shall be exercised by him either directly or through officers
subordinate to him in accordance with this Constitution (Article 154).
(b)  There shall be a council of ministers with the chief minister as the
head to aid and advise the governor in the exercise of his functions,
except in so far as he is required to exercise his functions in his
discretion (Article 163).
(c)  The council of ministers shall be collectively responsible to the
legislative assembly of the state (Article 164). This provision is the
foundation of the parliamentary system of government in the state.
From the above, it is clear that constitutional position of the governor
differs from that of the president in the following two respects:6
1.  While the Constitution envisages the possibility of the governor
acting at times in his discretion, no such possibility has been envisaged
for the President.
2.  After the 42nd Constitutional Amendment (1976), ministerial
advice has been made binding on the President, but no such provision
has been made with respect to the governor.
The Constitution makes it clear that if any question arises whether a
matter falls within the governor’s discretion or not, the decision of the
governor is final and the validity of anything done by him cannot be called
in question on the ground that he ought or ought not to have acted in his
discretion. The governor has constitutional discretion in the following
cases:
1.  Reservation of a bill for the consideration of the President.
2.  Recommendation for the imposition of the President’s Rule in the
state.
3.  While exercising his functions as the administrator of an adjoining
union territory (in case of additional charge).
4.  Determining the amount payable by the Government of Assam,
Meghalaya, Tripura and Mizoram to an autonomous Tribal District
Council as royalty accruing from licenses for mineral exploration7
 .
5.  Seeking information from the chief minister with regard to the
administrative and legislative matters of the state.
In addition to the above constitutional discretion (i.e., the express
discretion mentioned in the Constitution), the governor, like the president,
also has situational discretion (i.e., the hidden discretion derived from the
exigencies of a prevailing political situation) in the following cases:
1.  Appointment of chief minister when no party has a clear-cut
majority in the state legislative assembly or when the chief minister in
office dies suddenly and there is no obvious successor.
2.  Dismissal of the council of ministers when it cannot prove the
confidence of the state legislative assembly.
3.  Dissolution of the state legislative assembly if the council of
ministers has lost its majority.

Moreover, the governor has certain special responsibilities to discharge
according to the directions issued by the President. In this regard, the
governor, though has to consult the council of ministers led by the chief
minister, acts finally on his discretion. They are as follows:
1.  Maharashtra–Establishment of separate development boards for
Vidarbha and Marathwada.
2.  Gujarat–Establishment of separate development boards for
Saurashtra and Kutch.
3.  Nagaland–With respect to law and order in the state for so long as
the internal disturbance in the Naga Hills-TUensang Area continues.
4.  Assam–With respect to the administration of tribal areas.
5.  Manipur–Regarding the administration of the hill areas in the state.
6.  Sikkim–For peace and for ensuring social and economic
advancement of the different sections of the population.
7.  Arunachal Pradesh–With respect to law and order in the state.
8.  Karnataka - Establishment of a separate development board for
Hyderabad-Karnataka region8
 .
Thus, the Constitution has assigned a dual role to the office of a governor
in the Indian federal system. He is the constitutional head of the state as
well as the representative of the Centre (i.e., President).

Tripura and Mizoram.
8.  This provision was added by the 98th Constitutional Amendment
Act of 2012.
31 Chief Minister
In the scheme of parliamentary system of government provided by the
Constitution, the governor is the nominal executive authority (de jure
executive) and the Chief Minister is the real executive authority (de facto
executive). In other words, the governor is the head of the state while the
Chief Minister is the head of the government. Thus the position of the Chief
Minister at the state level is analogous to the position of prime minister at
the Centre.
APPOINTMENT OF CHIEF MINISTER
The Constitution does not contain any specific procedure for the selection
and appointment of the Chief Minister. Article 164 only says that the Chief
Minister shall be appointed by the governor. However, this does not imply
that the governor is free to appoint any one as the Chief Minister. In
accordance with the conventions of the parliamentary system of
government, the governor has to appoint the leader of the majority party in
the state legislative assembly as the Chief Minister. But, when no party has
a clear majority in the assembly, then the governor may exercise his
personal discretion in the selection and appointment of the Chief Minister.
In such a situation, the governor usually appoints the leader of the largest
party or coalition in the assembly as the Chief Minister and ask him to seek
a vote of confidence in the House within a month.1
The governor may have to exercise his individual judgement in the
selection and appointed of the Chief Minister when the Chief Minister in
office dies suddenly and there is no obvious successor. However, on the
death of a Chief Minister, the ruling party usually elects a new leader and
the governor has no choice but to appoint him as Chief Minister.
The Constitution does not require that a person must prove his majority
in the legislative assembly before he is appointed as the Chief Minister. The
governor may first appoint him as the Chief Minister and then ask him to
prove his majority in the legislative assembly within a reasonable period.
This is what has been done in a number of cases2
 .
A person who is not a member of the state legislature can be appointed as
Chief Minister for six months, within which time, he should be elected to
the state legislature, failing which he ceases to be the Chief Minister.
3
According to the Constitution, the Chief Minister may be a member of
any of the two Houses of a state legislature. Usually Chief Ministers have
been selected from the Lower House (legislative assembly), but, on a
number of occasions, a member of the Upper House (legislative council)
has also been appointed as Chief Minister.
4
OATH, TERM AND SALARY
Before the Chief Minister enters his office, the governor administers to him
the oaths of office and secrecy.
5
In his oath of office, the Chief Minister
swears:
1.  to bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of India,
2.  to uphold the sovereignty and integrity of India,
3.  to faithfully and conscientiously discharge the duties of his office,
and
4.  to do right to all manner of people in accordance with the
Constitution and the law, without fear or favour, affection or ill-will.
In his oath of secrecy, the Chief Minister swears that he will not directly
or indirectly communicate or reveal to any person(s) any matter that is
brought under his consideration or becomes known to him as a state
minister except as may be required for the due discharge of his duties as
such minister.
The term of the Chief Minister is not fixed and he holds office during the
pleasure of the governor. However, this does not mean that the governor can
dismiss him at any time. He cannot be dismissed by the governor as long as
he enjoys the majority support in the legislative assembly.
6 But, if he loses
the confidence of the assembly, he must resign or the governor can dismiss
him.
The salary and allowances of the Chief Minister are determined by the
state legislature. In addition to the salary and allowances, which are payable
to a member of the state legislature, he gets a sumptuary allowance, free
accommodation, travelling allowance, medical facilities, etc.
POWERS AND FUNCTIONS OF CHIEF MINISTER
The powers and functions of the Chief Minister can be studied under the
following heads:
In Relation to Council of Ministers
The Chief Minister enjoys the following powers as head of the state council
of ministers:
(a)  The governor appoints only those persons as ministers who are
recommended by the Chief Minister.
(b)  He allocates and reshuffles the portfolios among ministers.
(c)  He can ask a minister to resign or advise the governor to dismiss
him in case of difference of opinion.
(d)  He presides over the meetings of the council of ministers and
influences its decisions.
(e)  He guides, directs, controls and coordinates the activities of all the
ministers.
(f)  He can bring about the collapse of the council of ministers by
resigning from office. Since the Chief Minister is the head of the
council of ministers, his resignation or death automatically dissolves
the council of ministers. The resignation or death of any other minister,
on the other hand, merely creates a vacancy, which the Chief Minister
may or may not like to fill.
In Relation to the Governor
The Chief Minister enjoys the following powers in relation to the governor:
(a)  He is the principal channel of communication between the
governor and the council of ministers.7
It is the duty of the Chief
Minister:
(i) to communicate to the Governor of the state all decisions of
the council of ministers relating to the administration of the
affairs of the state and proposals for legislation;
(ii) to furnish such information relating to the administration of
the affairs of the state and proposals for legislation as the
governor may call for; and
(iii) if the governor so requires, to submit for the consideration of
the council of ministers any matter on which a decision has
been taken by a minister but which has not been considered
by the council.
(b)  He advises the governor with regard to the appointment of
important officials like advocate general, chairman and members of the
state public service commission, state election commissioner, and so
on.
In Relation to State Legislature
The Chief Minister enjoys the following powers as the leader of the house:
(a)  He advises the governor with regard to the summoning and
proroguing of the sessions of the state legislature.
(b)  He can recommend the dissolution of the legislative assembly to
the governor at any time.
(c)  He announces the government policies on the floor of the house.
Other Powers and Functions
In addition, the Chief Minister also performs the following functions:
(a)  He is the chairman of the State Planning Board.
(b)  He acts as a vice-chairman of the concerned zonal council by
rotation, holding office for a period of one year at a time.8
(c)  He is a member of the Inter-State Council and the Governing
Council of NITI Aayog, both headed by the prime minister.
(d)  He is the chief spokesman of the state government.
(e)  He is the crisis manager-in-chief at the political level during
emergencies.
(f)  As a leader of the state, he meets various sections of the people and
receives memoranda from them regarding their problems, and so on.
(g)  He is the political head of the services.
Thus, he plays a very significant and highly crucial role in the state
administration. However, the discretionary powers enjoyed by the governor
reduces to some extent the power, authority, influence, prestige and role of
the Chief Minister in the state administration.
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE GOVERNOR
The following provisions of the Constitution deal with the relationship
between the governor and the Chief Minister:
1.  Article 163: There shall be a council of ministers with the Chief
Minister as the head to aid and advise the governor on the exercise of
his functions, except in so far as he is required to exercise his functions
or any of them in his discretion.
2.  Article 164:
(a)  The Chief Minister shall be appointed by the governor and other
ministers shall be appointed by the governor on the advise of the Chief
Minister;
(b)  The ministers shall hold office during the pleasure of the governor;
and
(c)  The council of ministers shall be collectively responsible to the
legislative assembly of the state.
3.  Article 167: It shall be the duty of the Chief Minister:
(a)  to communicate to the governor of the state all decisions of the
council of ministers relating to the administration of the affairs of the
state and proposals for legislation;
(b)  to furnish such information relating to the administration of the
affairs of the state and proposals for legislation as the governor may
call for; and
(c)  if the governor so requires, to submit for the consideration of the
council of ministers any matter on which a decision has been taken by
a minister but which has not been considered by the council.

NOTES AND REFERENCES
1.  For example, the governors of Tamil Nadu (1951), Rajasthan
(1967), and Haryana (1982) invited the leader of the largest party to
form the ministry. The governors of Punjab (1967), West Bengal
(1970), and Maharashtra (1978), on the other hand, invited the leader
of the coalition to form the ministry.
2.  For example, the governor of J & K (Jagmohan) appointed G.M.
Shah as the Chief Minister and asked him to prove his majority on the
floor of the House within a month. He proved his majority. Similarly,
the Governor of Andhra Pradesh (Ram Lal) appointed Bhasker Rao as
the Chief Minister and gave him one month to prove his majority on
the floor of the House. However, he could not prove his majority.
3.  For example, Bansilal and S.B. Chavan were appointed as Chief
Ministers of Haryana and Maharashtra respectively, even though they
were not members of the state legislature. Subsequently, they were
elected to the state legislature.
4.  For example, C. Rajagopalachari in Madras (now Tamil Nadu) in
1952, Morarji Desai in Bombay (now Maharashtra) in 1952, C.B.
Gupta in UP in 1960 and B.P. Mandal in Bihar in 1968 were appointed
as Chief Ministers, while they were members of the state legislative
council.
5.  The form of oath of office and secrecy for the Chief Minister is
similar to that for any state minister. See Chapter 32.
6.  This was ruled by the Supreme Court in S.R. Bommai v. Union of
India, (1994). However, there have been many violations of this rule,
whereby the governors have dismissed the Chief Ministers without
giving them an opportunity to prove their majority in the legislative
assembly.
7.  Article 167 specifically deals with this function of the Chief
Minister.
8.  Union home minister is the chairman of all the zonal councils.
32 State Council of Ministers
As the Constitution of India provides for a parliamentary system of
government in the states on the Union pattern, the council of ministers
headed by the chief minister is the real executive authority in the politicoadministrative system of a state. The council of ministers in the states is
constituted and function in the same way as the council of ministers at the
Centre.
The principles of parliamentary system of government are not detailed in
the Constitution; but two Articles (163 and 164) deal with them in a broad,
sketchy and general manner. Article 163 deals with the status of the council
of ministers while Article 164 deals with the appointment, tenure,
responsibility, qualifications, oath and salaries and allowances of the
ministers.
CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS
Article 163–Council of Ministers to aid and advise Governor
1.  There shall be a Council of Ministers with the Chief Minister as the
head to aid and advise the Governor in the exercise of his functions,
except in so far as he is required to exercise his functions in his
discretion.
2.  If any question arises whether a matter falls within the Governor’s
discretion or not, decision of the Governor shall be final, and the

scheduled castes and backward classes or any other work. The state of
Bihar was excluded from this provision by the 94th Amendment Act of
2006.
2.  The total number of ministers, including the chief minister, in the
council of ministers in a state shall not exceed 15 per cent of the total
strength of the legislative assembly of that state. But, the number of
ministers, including the chief minister, in a state shall not be less than
12. This provision was added by the 91st
 Amendment Act of 2003.
3.  A member of either House of state legislature belonging to any
political party who is disqualified on the ground of defection shall also
be disqualified to be appointed as a minister. This provision was also
added by the 91st
 Amendment Act of 2003.
4.  The ministers shall hold office during the pleasure of the Governor.
5.  The council of ministers shall be collectively responsible to the
state Legislative Assembly.
6.  The Governor shall administer the oaths of office and secrecy to a
minister.
7.  A minister who is not a member of the state legislature for any
period of six consecutive months shall cease to be a minister.
8.  The salaries and allowances of ministers shall be determined by the
state legislature.
Article 166–Conduct of Business of the Government of a State
1.  All executive action of the Government of a State shall be
expressed to be taken in the name of the Governor.
2.  Orders and other instruments made and executed in the name of the
Governor shall be authenticated in such manner as may be specified in
rules to be made by the Governor. Further, the validity of an order or
instrument which is so authenticated shall not be called in question on
the ground that it is not an order or instrument made or executed by the
Governor.
3.  The Governor shall make rules for the more convenient transaction
of the business of the government of the state, and for the allocation
among ministers of the said business in so far as it is not business with
respect to which the Governor is required to act in his discretion.
Article 167–Duties of Chief Minister
It shall be the duty of the Chief Minister of each state
1.  To communicate to the governor of the state all decisions of the
council of ministers relating to the administration of the affairs of the
state and proposals for legislation
2.  To furnish such information relating to the administration of the
affairs of the state and proposals for legislation as the governor may
call for
3.  If the governor so requires, to submit for the consideration of the
council of ministers any matter on which a decision has been taken by
a minister but which has not been considered by the council
Article 177–Rights of Ministers as Respects the Houses
Every minister shall have the right to speak and take part in the proceedings
of the Assembly (and also the Council where it exists) and any Committee
of the State Legislature of which he may be named a member. But he shall
not be entitled to vote.
NATURE OF ADVICE BY MINISTERS
Article 163 provides for a council of ministers with the chief minister at the
head to aid and advise the governor in the exercise of his functions except
the discretionary ones. If any question arises whether a matter falls within
the governor’s discretion or not, the decision of the governor is final and the
validity of anything done by him cannot be called in question on the ground
that he ought or ought not to have acted in his discretion. Further, the nature
of advice tendered by ministers to the governor cannot be enquired by any
court. This provision emphasises the intimate and the confidential
relationship between the governor and the ministers.
In 1971, the Supreme Court ruled that a council of ministers must always
exist to advise the governor, even after the dissolution of the state
legislative assembly or resignation of a council of ministers. Hence, the
existing ministry may continue in the office until its successor assumes
charge. Again in 1974, the Court clarified that except in spheres where the
governor is to act in his discretion, the governor has to act on the aid and
advice of the council of ministers in the exercise of his powers and
functions. He is not required to act personally without the aid and advice of
the council of ministers or against the aid and advice of the council of
ministers. Wherever the Constitution requires the satisfaction of the
governor, the satisfaction is not the personal satisfaction of the governor but
it is the satisfaction of the council of ministers.
APPOINTMENT OF MINISTERS
The chief minister is appointed by the governor. The other ministers are
appointed by the governor on the advice of the chief minister. This means
that the governor can appoint only those persons as ministers who are
recommended by the chief minister.
But, there should be a tribal welfare minister in Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand,
Madhya Pradesh and Odisha1
. Originally, this provision was applicable to
Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Odisha. The 94th Amendment Act of 2006 freed
Bihar from the obligation of having a tribal welfare minister as there are no
Scheduled Areas in Bihar now and the fraction of population of the
Scheduled Tribes is very small. The same Amendment also extended the
above provision to the newly formed states of Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand.
Usually, the members of the state legislature, either the legislative
assembly or the legislative council, are appointed as ministers. A person
who is not a member of either House of the state legislature can also be
appointed as a minister. But, within six months, he must become a member
(either by election or by nomination) of either House of the state legislature,
otherwise, he ceases to be a minister.
A minister who is a member of one House of the state legislature has the
right to speak and to take part in the proceedings of the other House. But, he
can vote only in the House of which he is a member.
OATH AND SALARY OF MINISTERS
Before a minister enters upon his office, the governor administers to him
the oaths of office and secrecy. In his oath of office, the minister swears:
1.  to bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of India,
2.  to uphold the sovereignty and integrity of India,
3.  to faithfully and conscientiously discharge the duties of his office,
and
4.  to do right to all manner of people in accordance with the
Constitution and the law, without fear or favour, affection or ill-will.
In his oath of secrecy, the minister swears that he will not directly or
indirectly communicate or reveal to any person(s) any matter that is brought
under his consideration or becomes known to him as a state minister except
as may be required for the due discharge of his duties as such minister.
The salaries and allowances of ministers are determined by the state
legislature from time to time. A minister gets the salary and allowances
which are payable to a member of the state legislature. Additionally, he gets
a sumptuary allowance (according to his rank), free accommodation,
travelling allowance, medical facilities, etc.
RESPONSIBILITY OF MINISTERS
Collective Responsibility
The fundamental principle underlying the working of parliamentary system
of government is the principle of collective responsibility. Article 164
clearly states that the council of ministers is collectively responsible to the
legislative assembly of the state. This means that all the ministers own joint
responsibility to the legislative assembly for all their acts of omission and
commission. They work as a team and swim or sink together. When the
legislative assembly passes a no-confidence motion against the council of
ministers, all the ministers have to resign including those ministers who are
from the legislative council2
. Alternatively, the council of ministers can
advice the governor to dissolve the legislative assembly on the ground that
the House does not represent the views of the electorate faithfully and call
for fresh elections. The governor may not oblige the council of ministers
which has lost the confidence of the legislative assembly.
The principle of collective responsibility also mean that the cabinet
decisions bind all cabinet ministers (and other ministers) even if they
deferred in the cabinet meeting. It is the duty of every minister to stand by
the cabinet decisions and support them both within and outside the state
legislature. If any minister disagrees with a cabinet decision and is not
prepared to defend it, he must resign. Several ministers have resigned in the
past owing to their differences with the cabinet.
Individual Responsibility
Article 164 also contains the principle of individual responsibility. It states
that the ministers hold office during the pleasure of the governor. This
means that the governor can remove a minister at a time when the council
of ministers enjoys the confidence of the legislative assembly. But, the
governor can remove a minister only on the advice of the chief minister. In
case of difference of opinion or dissatisfaction with the performance of a
minister, the chief minister can ask him to resign or advice the governor to
dismiss him. By exercising this power, the chief minister can ensure the
realisation of the rule of collective responsibility.
No Legal Responsibility
As at the Centre, there is no provision in the Constitution for the system of
legal responsibility of the minister in the states. It is not required that an
order of the governor for a public act should be countersigned by a minister.
Moreover, the courts are barred from enquiring into the nature of advice
rendered by the ministers to the governor.
COMPOSITION OF THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS
The Constitution does not specify the size of the state council of ministers
or the ranking of ministers. They are determined by the chief minister
according to the exigencies of the time and requirements of the situation.
Like at the Centre, in the states too, the council of ministers consists of
three categories of ministers, namely, cabinet ministers, ministers of state,
and deputy ministers. The difference between them lies in their respective
ranks, emoluments, and political importance. At the top of all these
ministers stands the chief minister–supreme governing authority in the
state.
The cabinet ministers head the important departments of the state
government like home, education, finance, agriculture and so forth3
. They
are members of the cabinet, attend its meetings and play an important role
in deciding policies. Thus, their responsibilities extend over the entire
gamut of state government.
The ministers of state can either be given independent charge of
departments or can be attached to cabinet ministers. However, they are not
members of the cabinet and do not attend the cabinet meetings unless
specially invited when something related to their departments are
considered by the cabinet.
Next in rank are the deputy ministers. They are not given independent
charge of departments. They are attached to the cabinet ministers and assist
them in their administrative, political and parliamentary duties. They are
not members of the cabinet and do not attend cabinet meetings.
At times, the council of ministers may also include a deputy chief
minister. The deputy chief ministers are appointed mostly for local political
reasons.
CABINET
A smaller body called cabinet is the nucleus of the council of ministers. It
consists of only the cabinet ministers. It is the real centre of authority in the
state government. It performs the following role:
1.  It is the highest decisionmaking authority in the politicoadministrative system of a state.
2.  It is the chief policy formulating body of the state government.
3.  It is the supreme executive authority of the state government.
4.  It is the chief coordinator of state administration.
5.  It is an advisory body to the governor.
6.  It is the chief crisis manager and thus deals with all emergency
situations.
7.  It deals with all major legislative and financial matters.
8.  It exercises control over higher appointments like constitutional
authorities and senior secretariat administrators.
Cabinet Committees
The cabinet works through various committees called cabinet committees.
They are of two types–standing and ad hoc. The former are of a permanent
nature while the latter are of a temporary nature.
They are set up by the chief minister according to the exigencies of the
time and requirements of the situation. Hence, their number, nomenclature
and composition varies from time to time.
They not only sort out issues and formulate proposals for the
consideration of the cabinet but also take decisions. However, the cabinet
can review their decisions.

chief minister amounts to the resignation of the entire council of
ministers.
3.  The term ‘ministry’ or ‘ministries’ is used only in the centre and not
in the states. In other words, the state government is divided into
departments and not ministries.
33 State Legislature
The state legislature occupies a preeminent and central position in the
political system of a state.
Articles 168 to 212 in Part VI of the Constitution deal with the
organisation, composition, duration, officers, procedures, privileges, powers
and so on of the state legislature. Though these are similar to that of
Parliament, there are some differences as well.
ORGANISATION OF STATE LEGISLATURE
There is no uniformity in the organisation of state legislatures. Most of the
states have an unicameral system, while others have a bicameral system. At
present (2019), only six states have two Houses (bicameral). These are
Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Maharashtra and
Karnataka. The Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Council was abolishes by
the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, 2019.1 The Tamil Nadu
Legislative Council Act, 2010 has not come into force. The Legislative
Council in Andhra Pradesh was revived by the Andhra Pradesh Legislative
Council Act, 2005. The 7
th Amendment Act of 1956 provided for a
Legislative Council in Madhya Pradesh. However, a notification to this
effect has to be made by the President. So far, no such notification has been
made. Hence, Madhya Pradesh continues to have one House only.
The twenty-two states have unicameral system. Here, the state legislature
consists of the governor and the legislative assembly. In the states having
bicameral system, the state legislature consists of the governor, the
legislative council and the legislative assembly. The legislative council
(Vidhan Parishad) is the upper house (second chamber or house of elders),
while the legislative assembly (Vidhan Sabha) is the lower house (first
chamber or popular house).
The Constitution provides for the abolition or creation of legislative
councils in states. Accordingly, the Parliament can abolish a legislative
council (where it already exists) or create it (where it does not exist), if the
legislative assembly of the concerned state passes a resolution to that effect.
Such a specific resolution must be passed by the state assembly by a special
majority, that is, a majority of the total membership of the assembly and a
majority of not less than two-thirds of the members of the assembly present
and voting. This Act of Parliament is not to be deemed as an amendment of
the Constitution for the purposes of Article 368 and is passed like an
ordinary piece of legislation (ie, by simple majority).
“The idea of having a second chamber in the states was criticised in the
Constituent Assembly on the ground that it was not representative of the
people, that it delayed legislative process and that it was an expensive
institution2
.” Consequently the provision was made for the abolition or
creation of a legislative council to enable a state to have a second chamber
or not according to its own willingness and financial strength. For example,
Andhra Pradesh got the legislative council created in 1957 and got the same
abolished in 1985. The Legislative Council in Andhra Pradesh was again
revived in 2007, after the enactment of the Andhra Pradesh Legislative
Council Act, 2005. The legislative council of Tamil Nadu had been
abolished in 1986 and that of Punjab and West Bengal in 1969.
In 2010, the Legislative Assembly of Tamil Nadu passed a resolution for
the revival of the Legislative Council in the state. Accordingly, the
Parliament enacted the Tamil Nadu Legislative Council Act, 2010 which
provided for the creation of Legislative Council in the state. However,
before this Act was enforced, the Legislative Assembly of Tamil Nadu
passed another resolution in 2011 seeking the abolition of the proposed
Legislative Council.
COMPOSITION OF TWO HOUSES
Composition of Assembly
Strength
The legislative assembly consists of representatives directly elected by the
people on the basis of universal adult franchise. Its maximum strength is
fixed at 500 and minimum strength at 60. It means that its strength varies
from 60 to 500 depending on the population size of the state3
. However, in
case of Arunachal Pradesh, Sikkim and Goa, the minimum number is fixed
at 30 and in case of Mizoram and Nagaland, it is 40 and 46 respectively.
Further, some members of the legislative assemblies in Sikkim and
Nagaland are also elected indirectly.
Nominated Member
The governor can nominate one member from the Anglo-Indian
community, if the community is not adequately represented in the
assembly.
4 Originally, this provision was to operate for ten years (ie, upto
1960). But this duration has been extended continuously since then by 10
years each time. Now, under the 95th Amendment Act of 2009, this is to
last until 2020.
Territorial Constituencies
For the purpose of holding direct elections to the assembly, each state is
divided into territorial constituencies. The demarcation of these
constituencies is done in such a manner that the ratio between the
population of each constituency and the number of seats allotted to it isthe
same throughout the state. In other words, the Constitution ensures that
there is uniformity of representation between different constituencies in the
state. The expression ‘population’ means, the population as ascertained at
the last preceding census of which the relevant figures have been published.
Readjustment after each census
After each census, a readjustment is to be made in the (a) total number of
seats in the assembly of each state and (b) the division of each state into
territorial constituencies. The Parliament is empowered to determine the
authority and the manner in which it is to be made. Accordingly, Parliament
has enacted the Delimitation Commission Acts in 1952, 1962, 1972 and
2002 for this purpose.
The 42nd Amendment Act of 1976 had frozen total number of seats in
the assembly of each state and the division of such state into territorial
constituencies till the year 2000 at the 1971 level. This ban on readjustment
has been extended for another years (i.e., upto year 2026) by the 84th
Amendment Act of 2001 with the same objective of encouraging population
limiting measures.
The 84th Amendment Act of 2001 also empowered the government to
undertake readjustment and rationalisation of territorial constituencies in a
state on the basis of the population figures of 1991 census. Later, the 87th
Amendment Act of 2003 provided for the delimitation of constituencies on
the basis of 2001 census and not 1991 census. However, this can be done
without altering the total number of seats in the assembly of each state.
Reservation of seats for SCs and STs
The Constitution provided for the reservation of seats for scheduled castes
and scheduled tribes in the assembly of each state on the basis of population
ratios.5
Originally, this reservation was to operate for ten years (i.e., up to 1960).
But this duration has been extended continuously since then by 10 years
each time. Now, under the 95th Amendment Act of 2009, this reservation is
to last until 2020.
Composition of Council
Strength
Unlike the members of the legislative assembly, the members of the
legislative council are indirectly elected. The maximum strength of the
council is fixed at one-third of the total strength of the assembly and the
minimum strength is fixed at 406
. It means that the size of the council
depends on the size of the assembly of the concerned state. This is done to
ensure the predominance of the directly elected House (assembly) in the
legislative affairs of the state. Though the Constitution has fixed the
maximum and the minimum limits, the actual strength of a Council is fixed
by Parliament7
 .
Manner of Election
Of the total number of members of a legislative council:
1.  1/3 are elected by the members of local bodies in the state like
municipalities, district boards, etc.,
2.  1/12 are elected by graduates of three years standing and residing
within the state,
3.  1/12 are elected by teachers of three years standing in the state, not
lower in standard than secondary school,
4.  1/3 are elected by the members of the legislative assembly of the
state from amongst persons who are not members of the assembly, and
5.  the remainder are nominated by the governor from amongst persons
who have a special knowledge or practical experience of literature,
science, art, cooperative movement and social service.
Thus, 5/6 of the total number of members of a legislative council are
indirectly elected and 1/6 are nominated by the governor. The members are
elected in accordance with the system of proportional representation by
means of a single transferable vote. The bonafide or propriety of the
governor’s nomination in any case cannot be challenged in the courts.
This scheme of composition of a legislative council as laid down in the
Constitution is tentative and not final. The Parliament is authorised to
modify or replace the same. However, it has not enacted any such law so
far.
DURATION OF TWO HOUSES
Duration of Assembly
Like the Lok Sabha, the legislative assembly is not a continuing chamber.
Its normal term is five years from the date of its first meeting after the
general elections8
. The expiration of the period of five years operates as
automatic dissolution of the assembly. However, the governor is authorised
to dissolve the assembly at any time (i.e., even before the completion of
five years) to pave the way for fresh elections.
Further, the term of the assembly can be extended during the period of
national emergency by a law of Parliament for one year at a time (for any
length of time). However, this extension cannot continue beyond a period of
six months after the emergency has ceased to operate. This means that the
assembly should be re-elected within six months after the revocation of
emergency.
Duration of Council
Like the Rajya Sabha, the legislative council is a continuing chamber, that
is, it is a permanent body and is not subject to dissolution. But, one-third of
its members retire on the expiration of every second year. So, a member
continues as such for six years. The vacant seats are filled up by fresh
elections and nominations (by governor) at the beginning of every third
year. The retiring members are also eligible for re-election and renomination any number of times.
MEMBERSHIP OF STATE LEGISLATURE
1. Qualifications
The Constitution lays down the following qualifications for a person to be
chosen a member of the state legislature.
(a)  He must be a citizen of India.
(b)  He must make and subscribe to an oath or affirmation before the
person authorised by the Election Commission for this purpose. In his
oath or affirmation, he swears
(i) To bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of India
(ii) To uphold the sovereignty and integrity of India
(c)  He must be not less than 30 years of age in the case of the
legislative council and not less than 25 years of age in the case of the
legislative assembly.
(d)  He must posses other qualifications prescribed by Parliament.
Accordingly, the Parliament has laid down the following additional
qualifications in the Representation of People Act (1951):
(a)  A person to be elected to the legislative council must be an elector
for an assembly constituency in the concerned state and to be qualified
for the governor’s nomination, he must be a resident in the concerned
state.
(b)  A person to be elected to the legislative assembly must be an
elector for an assembly constituency in the concerned state.
(c)  He must be a member of a scheduled caste or scheduled tribe if he
wants to contest a seat reserved for them. However, a member of
scheduled castes or scheduled tribes can also contest a seat not
reserved for them.
2. Disqualifications
Under the Constitution, a person shall be disqualified for being chosen as
and for being a member of the legislative assembly or legislative council of
a state:
(a)  if he holds any office of profit under the Union or state
government (except that of a minister or any other office exempted by
state legislature9
 ),
(b)  if he is of unsound mind and stands so declared by a court,
(c)  if he is an undischarged insolvent,
(d)  if he is not a citizen of India or has voluntarily acquired the
citizenship of a foreign state or is under any acknowledgement of
allegiance to a foreign state, and
(e)  if he is so disqualified under any law made by Parliament.
Accordingly, the Parliament has prescribed a number of additional
disqualifications in the Representation of People Act (1951). These are
similar to those for Parliament. These are mentioned here:
1.  He must not have been found guilty of certain election offences or
corrupt practices in the elections.
2.  He must not have been convicted for any offence resulting in
imprisonment for two or more years. But, the detention of a person
under a preventive detention law is not a disqualification.
3.  He must not have failed to lodge an account of his election
expenses within the time.
4.  He must not have any interest in government contracts, works or
services.
5.  He must not be a director or managing agent nor hold an office of
profit in a corporation in which the government has at least 25 per cent
share.
6.  He must not have been dismissed from government service for
corruption or disloyalty to the state.
7.  He must not have been convicted for promoting enmity between
different groups or for the offence of bribery.
8.  He must not have been punished for preaching and practicing social
crimes such as untouchability, dowry and sati.
On the question whether a member has become subject to any of the
above disqualifications, the governor’s decision is final. However, he
should obtain the opinion of the Election Commission and act accordingly.
Disqualification on Ground of Defection
The Constitution also lays down that a person shall be disqualified for being
a member of either House of state legislature if he is so disqualified on the
ground of defection under the provisions of the Tenth Schedule.
The question of disqualification under the Tenth Schedule is decided by
the Chairman, in the case of legislative council and, Speaker, in the case of
legislative assembly (and not by the governor). In 1992, the Supreme Court
ruled that the decision of Chairman/Speaker in this regard is subject to
judicial review10
 .
3. Oath or Affirmation
Every member of either House of state legislature, before taking his seat in
the House, has to make and subscribe an oath or affirmation before the
governor or some person appointed by him for this purpose.
In this oath, a member of the state legislature swears:
(a)  to bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of India;
(b)  to uphold the sovereignty and integrity of India; and
(c)  to faithfully discharge the duty of his office.
Unless a member takes the oath, he cannot vote and participate in the
proceedings of the House and does not become eligible to the privileges and
immunities of the state legislature.
A person is liable to a penalty of ₹500 for each day he sits or votes as a
member in a House:
(a)  before taking and subscribing the prescribed oath or affirmation; or
(b)  when he knows that he is not qualified or that he is disqualified for
its membership; or
(c)  when he knows that he is prohibited from sitting or voting in the
House by virtue of any law made by Parliament or the state legislature.
Members of a state legislature are entitled to receive such salaries and
allowances as may from time to time be determined by the state legislature.
4. Vacation of Seats
In the following cases, a member of the state legislature vacates his seat:
(a)  Double Membership: A person cannot be a member of both
Houses of state legislature at one and the same time. If a person is
elected to both the Houses, his seat in one of the Houses falls vacant as
per the provisions of a law made by the state legislature.
(b)  Disqualification: If a member of the state legislature becomes
subject to any of the disqualifications, his seat becomes vacant.
(c)  Resignation: A member may resign his seat by writing to the
Chairman of legislative council or Speaker of legislative assembly, as
the case may be. The seat falls vacant when the resignation is
accepted11
 .
(d)  Absence: A House of the state legislature can declare the seat of a
member vacant if he absents himself from all its meeting for a period
of sixty days without its permission.
(e)  Other Cases: A member has to vacate his seat in the either House
of state legislature,
(i) if his election is declared void by the court,
(ii) if he is expelled by the House,
(iii) if he is elected to the office of president or office of vicepresident, and
(iv) if he is appointed to the office of governor of a state.
PRESIDING OFFICERS OF STATE LEGISLATURE
Each House of state legislature has its own presiding officer. There is a
Speaker and a Deputy Speaker for the legislative assembly and a Chairman
and a Deputy Chairman for the legislative council. A panel of chairman for
the assembly and a panel of vice-chairman for the council is also appointed.
Speaker of Assembly
The Speaker is elected by the assembly itself from amongst its members.
Usually, the Speaker remains in office during the life of the assembly.
However, he vacates his office earlier in any of the following three cases:
1.  if he ceases to be a member of the assembly;
2.  if he resigns by writing to the deputy speaker; and
3.  if he is removed by a resolution passed by a majority of all the then
members of the assembly. Such a resolution can be moved only after
giving 14 days advance notice.
The Speaker has the following powers and duties:
1.  He maintains order and decorum in the assembly for conducting its
business and regulating its proceedings. This is his primary
responsibility and he has final power in this regard.
2.  He is the final interpreter of the provisions of (a) the Constitution of
India, (b) the rules of procedure and conduct of business of assembly,
and (c) the legislative precedents, within the assembly.
3.  He adjourns the assembly or suspends the meeting in the absence of
a quorum.
4.  He does not vote in the first instance. But, he can exercise a casting
vote in the case of a tie.
5.  He can allow a ‘secret’ sitting of the House at the request of the
leader of the House.
6.  He decides whether a bill is a Money Bill or not and his decision on
this question is final.
7.  He decides the questions of disqualification of a member of the
assembly, arising on the ground of defection under the provisions of
the Tenth Schedule.
8.  He appoints the chairman of all the committees of the assembly and
supervises their functioning. He himself is the chairman of the
Business Advisory Committee, the Rules Committee and the General
Purpose Committee.
Deputy Speaker of Assembly
Like the Speaker, the Deputy Speaker is also elected by the assembly itself
from amongst its members. He is elected after the election of the Speaker
has taken place.
Like the Speaker, the Deputy Speaker remains in office usually during
the life of the assembly. However, he also vacates his office earlier in any of
the following three cases:
1.  if he ceases to be a member of the assembly;
2.  if he resigns by writing to the speaker; and
3.  if he is removed by a resolution passed by a majority of all the then
members of the assembly. Such a resolution can be moved only after
giving 14 days’ advance notice.
The Deputy Speaker performs the duties of the Speaker’s office when it
is vacant. He also acts as the Speaker when the latter is absent from the
sitting of assembly. In both the cases, he has all the powers of the Speaker.
The Speaker nominates from amongst the members a panel of chairman.
Any one of them can preside over the assembly in the absence of the
Speaker or the Deputy Speaker. He has the same powers as the speaker
when so presiding. He holds office until a new panel of chairman is
nominated.
Chairman of Council
The Chairman is elected by the council itself from amongst its members.
The Chairman vacates his office in any of the following three cases:
1.  if he ceases to be a member of the council;
2.  if he resigns by writing to the deputy chairman; and
3.  if he is removed by a resolution passed by a majority of all the then
members of the council. Such a resolution can be moved only after
giving 14 days advance notice.
As a presiding officer, the powers and functions of the Chairman in the
council are similar to those of the Speaker in the assembly. However, the
Speaker has one special power which is not enjoyed by the Chairman. The
Speaker decides whether a bill is a Money Bill or not and his decision on
this question is final.
The salaries and allowances of the Speaker and the Deputy Speaker of
the assembly and the Chairman and the Deputy Chairman of the council are
fixed by the state legislature. They are charged on the Consolidated Fund of
the State and thus are not subject to the annual vote of the state legislature.
Deputy Chairman of Council
Like the Chairman, the Deputy Chairman is also elected by the council
itself from amongst its members.
The deputy chairman vacates his office in any of the following three
cases:
1.  if he ceases to be a member of the council;
2.  if he resigns by writing to the Chairman; and
3.  if he is removed by a resolution passed by a majority of all the then
members of the council. Such a resolution can be moved only after
giving 14 days advance notice.
The Deputy Chairman performs the duties of the Chairman’s office when
it is vacant. He also acts as the Chairman when the latter is absent from the
sitting of the council. In both the cases, he has all the powers of the
Chairman.
The Chairman nominates from amongst the members a panel of vicechairman. Any one of them can preside over the council in the absence of
the Chairman or the Deputy Chairman. He has the same powers as the
chairman when so presiding. He holds office until a new panel of vicechairman is nominated.
SESSIONS OF STATE LEGISLATURE
Summoning
The governor from time to time summons each House of state legislature to
meet. The maximum gap between the two sessions of state legislature
cannot be more than six months, ie, the state legislature should meet at least
twice a year. A session of the state legislature consists of many sittings.
Adjournment
An adjournment suspends the work in a sitting for a specified time which
may be hours, days or weeks.
Adjournment sine die means terminating a sitting of the state legislature
for an indefinite period. The power of the adjournment as well as
adjournment sine die lies with the presiding officer of the House.
Prorogation
The presiding officer (Speaker or Chairman) declares the House adjourned
sine die, when the business of the session is completed. Within the next few
days, the governor issues a notification for prorogation of the session.
However, the governor can also prorogue the House which is in session.
Unlike an adjournment, a prorogation terminates a session of the House.
Dissolution
The legislative council, being a permanent house, is not subject to
dissolution. Only the legislative assembly is subject to dissolution. Unlike a
prorogation, a dissolution ends the very life of the existing House, and a
new House is constituted after the general elections are held.
The position with respect to lapsing of bills on the dissolution of the
assembly is mentioned below:
1.  A Bill pending in the assembly lapses (whether originating in the
assembly or transmitted to it by the council).
2.  A Bill passed by the assembly but pending in the council lapses.
3.  A Bill pending in the council but not passed by the assembly does
not lapse.
4.  A Bill passed by the assembly (in a unicameral state) or passed by
both the houses (in a bicameral state) but pending assent of the
governor or the President does not lapse.
5.  A Bill passed by the assembly (in a unicameral state) or passed by
both the Houses (in a bicameral state) but returned by the president for
reconsideration of House (s) does not lapse.
Quorum
Quorum is the minimum number of members required to be present in the
House before it can transact any business. It is ten members or one-tenth of
the total number of members of the House (including the presiding officer),
whichever is greater. If there is no quorum during a meeting of the House, it
is the duty of the presiding officer either to adjourn the House or to suspend
the meeting until there is a quorum.
Voting in House
All matters at any sitting of either House are decided by a majority of votes
of the members present and voting excluding the presiding officer. Only a
few matters which are specifically mentioned in the Constitution like
removal of the speaker of the assembly, removal of the Chairman of the
council and so on require special majority, not ordinary majority. The
presiding officer (i.e., Speaker in the case of assembly or chairman in the
case of council or the person acting as such) does not vote in the first
instance, but exercises a casting vote in the case of an equality of votes.
Language in State Legislature
The Constitution has declared the official language(s) of the state or Hindi
or English, to be the languages for transacting business in the state
legislature. However, the presiding officer can permit a member to address
the House in his mother-tongue. The state legislature is authorised to decide
whether to continue or discontinue English as a floor language after the
completion of fifteen years from the commencement of the Constitution
(i.e., from 1965). In case of Himachal Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya and
Tripura, this time limit is twenty-five years and that of Arunachal Pradesh,
Goa and Mizoram, it is forty years.
Rights of Ministers and Advocate General
In addition to the members of a House, every minister and the advocate
general of the state have the right to speak and take part in the proceedings
of either House or any of its committees of which he is named a member,
without being entitled to vote. There are two reasons underlying this
constitutional provision:
1.  A minister can participate in the proceedings of a House, of which
he is not a member.
2.  A minister, who is not a member of either House, can participate in
the proceedings of both the Houses12
 .
LEGISLATIVE PROCEDURE IN STATE
LEGISLATURE
Ordinary Bills
Bill in the Originating House
An ordinary bill can originate in either House of the state legislature (in
case of a bicameral legislature). Such a bill can be introduced either by a
minister or by any other member. The bill passes through three stages in the
originating House, viz,
1.  First reading,
2.  Second reading, and
3.  Third reading.
After the bill is passed by the originating House, it is transmitted to the
second House for consideration and passage. A bill is deemed to have been
passed by the state legislature only when both the Houses have agreed to it,
either with or without amendments. In case of a unicameral legislature, a
bill passed by the legislative assembly is sent directly to the governor for
his assent.
Bill in the Second House
In the second House also, the bill passes through all the three stages, that is,
first reading, second reading and third reading.
When a bill is passed by the legislative assembly and transmitted to the
legislative council, the latter has four alternatives before it:
1.  it may pass the bill as sent by the assembly (i.e., without
amendments);
2.  it may pass the bill with amendments and return it to the assembly
for reconsideration;
3.  it may reject the bill altogether; and
4.  it may not take any action and thus keep the bill pending.
If the council passes the bill without amendments or the assembly accepts
the amendments suggested by the council, the bill is deemed to have been
passed by both the Houses and the same is sent to the the governor for his
assent. On the other hand, if the assembly rejects the amendments suggested
by the council or the council rejects the bill altogether or the council does
not take any action for three months, then the assembly may pass the bill
again and transmit the same to the council. If the council rejects the bill
again or passes the bill with amendments not acceptable to the assembly or
does not pass the bill within one month, then the bill is deemed to have
been passed by both the Houses in the form in which it was passed by the
assembly for the second time.
Therefore, the ultimate power of passing an ordinary bill is vested in the
assembly. At the most, the council can detain or delay the bill for a period
of four months–three months in the first instance and one month in the
second instance. The Constitution does not provide for the mechanism of
joint sitting of both the Houses to resolve the disagreement between the two
Houses over a bill. On the other hand, there is a provision for joint sitting of
the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha to resolve a disagreement between the
two over an ordinary bill. Moreover, when a bill, which has originated in
the council and was sent to the assembly, is rejected by the assembly, the
bill ends and becomes dead.
Thus, the council has been given much lesser significance, position and
authority than that of the Rajya Sabha at the Centre.
Assent of the Governor
Every bill, after it is passed by the assembly or by both the Houses in case
of a bicameral legislature, is presented to the governor for his assent. There
are four alternatives before the governor:
1.  he may give his assent to the bill;
2.  he may withhold his assent to the bill;
3.  he may return the bill for reconsideration of the House or Houses;
and
4.  he may reserve the bill for the consideration of the President.
If the governor gives his assent to the bill, the bill becomes an Act and is
placed on the Statute Book. If the governor withholds his assent to the bill,
the bill ends and does not become an Act. If the governor returns the bill for
reconsideration and if the bill is passed by the House or both the Houses
again, with or without amendments, and presented to the governor for his
assent, the governor must give his assent to the bill. Thus, the governor
enjoys only a suspensive veto. The position is same at the Central level
also13
 .
Assent of the President
When a bill is reserved by the governor for the consideration of the
President, the President may either give his assent to the bill or withhold his
assent to the bill or return the bill for reconsideration of the House or
Houses of the state legislature. When a bill is so returned, the House or
Houses have to reconsider it within a period of six months. The bill is
presented again to the presidential assent after it is passed by the House or
Houses with or without amendments. It is not mentioned in the Constitution
whether it is obligatory on the part of the president to give his assent to such
a bill or not.
Money Bills
The Constitution lays down a special procedure for the passing of Money
Bills in the state legislature. This is as follows:
A Money Bill cannot be introduced in the legislative council. It can be
introduced in the legislative assembly only and that too on the
recommendation of the governor. Every such bill is considered to be a
government bill and can be introduced only by a minister.
After a Money Bill is passed by the legislative assembly, it is transmitted
to the legislative council for its consideration. The legislative council has
restricted powers with regard to a Money Bill. It cannot reject or amend a
Money Bill. It can only make recommendations and must return the bill to
the legislative assembly within 14 days. The legislative assembly can either
accept or reject all or any of the recommendations of the legislative council.
If the legislative assembly accepts any recommendation, the bill is then
deemed to have been passed by both the Houses in the modified form. If the
legislative assembly does not accept any recommendation, the bill is then
deemed to have been passed by both the Houses in the form originally
passed by the legislative assembly without any change.
If the legislative council does not return the bill to the legislative
assembly within 14 days, the bill is deemed to have been passed by both
Houses at the expiry of the said period in the form originally passed by the
legislative assembly. Thus, the legislative assembly has more powers than
legislative council with regard to a money bill. At the most, the legislative
council can detain or delay a money bill for a period of 14 days.
Finally, when a Money Bill is presented to the governor, he may either
give his assent, withhold his assent or reserve the bill for presidential assent
but cannot return the bill for reconsideration of the state legislature.
Normally, the governor gives his assent to a money bill as it is introduced in
the state legislature with his prior permission.
When a money bill is reserved for consideration of the President, the
president may either give his assent to the bill or withhold his assent to the
bill but cannot return the bill for reconsideration of the state legislature.

amendments.
have agreed to it, either with or without
amendments.
5.  A deadlock
between the two
Houses takes
place when the
second House,
after receiving a
bill passed by the
first House, rejects
the bill or
proposes
amendments that
are not acceptable
to the first House
or does not pass
the bill within six
months.
5.  A deadlock between the two Houses takes
place when the legislative council, after
receiving a bill passed by the legislative
assembly, rejects the bill or proposes
amendments that are not acceptable to the
legislative assembly or does not pass the bill
within three months.
6.  The
Constitution
provides for the
mechanism of
joint sitting of two
Houses of the
Parliament to
resolve a deadlock
between them
over the passage
of a bill.
6.  The Constitution does not provide for the
mechanism of joint sitting of two Houses of
the state legislature to resolve a deadlock
between them over the passage of a bill.
7.  The Lok
Sabha cannot
override the Rajya
Sabha by passing
the bill for the
second time and
vice versa. A joint
sitting is the only
way to resolve a
deadlock between
the two Houses.
7.  The legislative assembly can override the
legislative council by passing the bill for the
second time and not vice versa. When a bill is
passed by the assembly for the second time
and transmitted to the legislative council, if
the legislative council rejects the bill again, or
proposes amendments that are not acceptable
to the legislative assembly, or does not pass
the bill within one month, then the bill is
deemed to have been passed by both the
Houses in the form in which it was passed by
the legislative assembly for the second time.
8.  The
mechanism of
joint sitting for
resolving a
deadlock applies
to a bill whether
originating in the
Lok Sabha or the
Rajya Sabha. If a
joint sitting is not
summoned by the
president, the bill
ends and becomes
dead.
8.  The mechanism of passing the bill for the
second time to resolve a deadlock applies to a
bill originating in the legislative assembly
only. When a bill, which has originated in the
legislative council and sent to the legislative
assembly, is rejected by the latter, the bill
ends and becomes dead.
B. With Regard to Money Bills

POSITION OF LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL
The constitutional position of the council (as compared with the assembly)
can be studied from two angles:
A. Spheres where council is equal to assembly.
B. Spheres where council is unequal to assembly.
Equal with Assembly
In the following matters, the powers and status of the council are broadly
equal to that of the assembly:
1.  Introduction and passage of ordinary bills. However, in case of
disagreement between the two Houses, the will of the assembly
prevails over that of the council.
2.  Approval of ordinances issued by the governor14
 .
3.  Selection of ministers including the chief minister. Under the
Constitution the, ministers including the chief minister can be
members of either House of the state legislature. However, irrespective
of their membership, they are responsible only to the assembly.
4.  Consideration of the reports of the constitutional bodies like State
Finance Commission, state public service commission and
Comptroller and Auditor General of India.
5.  Enlargement of the jurisdiction of the state public service
commission.
Unequal with Assembly
In the following matters, the powers and status of the council are unequal to
that of the assembly:
1.  A Money Bill can be introduced only in the assembly and not in the
council.
2.  The council cannot amend or reject a money bill. It should return
the bill to the assembly within 14 days, either with recommendations
or without recommendations.
3.  The assembly can either accept or reject all or any of the
recommendation of the council. In both the cases, the money bill is
deemed to have been passed by the two Houses.
4.  The final power to decide whether a particular bill is a money bill
or not is vested in the Speaker of the assembly.
5.  The final power of passing an ordinary bill also lies with the
assembly. At the most, the council can detain or delay the bill for the
period of four months–three months in the first instance and one month
in the second instance. In other words, the council is not even a
revising body like the Rajya Sabha; it is only a dilatory chamber or an
advisory body.
6.  The council can only discuss the budget but cannot vote on the
demands for grants (which is the exclusive privilege of the assembly).
7.  The council cannot remove the council of ministers by passing a
no-confidence motion. This is because, the council of ministers is
collectively responsible only to the assembly. But, the council can
discus and criticise the policies and activities of the Government.
8.  When an ordinary bill, which has originated in the council and was
sent to the assembly, is rejected by the assembly, the bill ends and
becomes dead.
9.  The council does not participate in the election of the president of
India and representatives of the state in the Rajya Sabha.
10.  The council has no effective say in the ratification of a
constitutional amendment bill. In this respect also, the will of the
assembly prevails over that of the council15
 .
11.  Finally, the very existence of the council depends on the will of
the assembly. The council can be abolished by the Parliament on the
recommendation of the assembly.
From the above, it is clear that the position of the council vis-a-vis the
assembly is much weaker than the position of the Rajya Sabha vis-a-vis the
Lok Sabha. The Rajya Sabha has equal powers with the Lok Sabha in all
spheres except financial matters and with regard to the control over the
Government. On the other hand, the council is subordinate to the assembly
in all respects. Thus, the predominance of the assembly over the council is
fully established.
Even though both the council and the Rajya Sabha are second chambers,
the Constitution has given the council much lesser importance than the
Rajya Sabha due to the following reasons:
1.  The Rajya Sabha consists of the representatives of the states and
thus reflect the federal element of the polity. It maintains the federal
equilibrium by protecting the interests of the states against the undue
interference of the Centre. Therefore, it has to be an effective revising
body and not just an advisory body or dilatory body like that of the
council. Onthe other hand, the issue of federal significance does not
arise in the case of a council.
2.  The council is heterogeneously constituted. It represents different
interests and consists of differently elected members and also include
some nominated members. Its very composition makes its position
weak and reduces its utility as an effective revising body. On the other
hand, the Rajya Sabha is homogeneously constituted. It represents only
the states and consists of mainly elected members (only 12 out of 250
are nominated).
3.  The position accorded to the council is in accordance with the
principles of democracy. The council should yield to the assembly,
which is a popular house. This pattern of relationship between the two
Houses of the state legislature is adopted from the British model. In
Britain, the House of Lords (Upper House) cannot oppose and obstruct
the House of Commons (Lower House). The House of Lords is only a
dilatory chamber–it can delay an ordinary bill for a maximum period
of one year and a money bill for one month.16
Keeping in view its weak, powerless and insignificant position and role,
the critics have described the council as a ‘secondary chamber’, ‘costly
ornamental luxury’, ‘white elephant’, etc. The critics have opined that the
council has served as a refuge for those who are defeated in the assembly
elections. It enabled the unpopular, rejected and ambitious politicians to
occupy the post of a chief minister or a minister or a member of the state
legislature.
Even though the council has been given less powers as compared with
the assembly, its utility is supported on the following grounds:
1.  It checks the hasty, defective, careless and ill-considered legislation
made by the assembly by making provision for revision and thought.
2.  It facilitates representation of eminent professionals and experts
who cannot face direct elections. The governor nominates one-sixth
members of the council to provide representation to such people.
PRIVILEGES OF STATE LEGISLATURE
Privileges of a state legislature are a sum of special rights, immunities and
exemptions enjoyed by the Houses of state legislature, their committees and
their members. They are necessary in order to secure the independence and
effectiveness of their actions. Without these privileges, the Houses can
neither maintain their authority, dignity and honour nor can protect their
members from any obstruction in the discharge of their legislative
responsibilities.
The Constitution has also extended the privileges of the state legislature
to those persons who are entitled to speak and take part in the proceedings
of a House of the state legislature or any of its committees. These include
advocate-general of the state and state ministers.
It must be clarified here that the privileges of the state legislature do not
extend to the governor who is also an integral part of the state legislature.
The privileges of a state legislature can be classified into two broad
categories–those that are enjoyed by each House of the state legislature
collectively, and those that are enjoyed by the members individually.
Collective Privileges
The privileges belonging to each House of the state legislature collectively
are:
1.  It has the right to publish its reports, debates and proceedings and
also the right to prohibit others from publishing the same17
 .
2.  It can exclude strangers from its proceedings and hold secret
sittings to discuss some important matters.
3.  It can make rules to regulate its own procedure and the conduct of
its business and to adjudicate upon such matters.
4.  It can punish members as well as outsiders for breach of its
privileges or its contempt by reprimand, admonition or imprisonment
(also suspension or expulsion, in case of members).
5.  It has the right to receive immediate information of the arrest,
detention, conviction, imprisonment and release of a member.
6.  It can institute inquiries and order the attendance of witnesses and
send for relevant papers and records.
7.  The courts are prohibited to inquire into the proceedings of a House
or its Committes.
8.  No person (either a member or outsider) can be arrested, and no
legal process (civil or criminal) can be served within the precincts of
the House without the permission of the presiding officer.
Individual Privileges
The privileges belonging to the members individually are:
1.  They cannot be arrested during the session of the state legislature
and 40 days before the beginning and 40 days after the end of such
session. This privilege is available only in civil cases and not in
criminal cases or preventive detention cases.
2.  They have freedom of speech in the state legislature. No member is
liable to any proceedings in any court for anything said or any vote
given by him in the state legislature or its committees. This freedom is
subject to the provisions of the Constitution and to the rules and
standing orders regulating the procedure of the state legislature18
 .
3.  They are exempted from jury service. They can refuse to give
evidence and appear as a witness in a case pending in a court when the
state legislature is in session.

15.  The position, in this regard, is very well analysed by J.C. Johari in
the following way: ‘The Constitution is not clear on this point whether
a bill of constitutional amendment referred to the states for ratification
by their legislatures shall include the Vidhan Parishad or not. In
practice, it may be understood that the will of the Vidhan Sabha has to
prevail. In case the Vidhan Parishad concurs with the view of the
Vidhan Sabha, it is all right; in case it differs, the Vidhan Sabha may
pass it again and thereby ignore the will of the Vidhan Parishad as it
can do in case of a non-money bill’. (Indian Government and Politics,

17.  The 44th Amendment Act of 1978 restored the freedom of the
press to publish true reports of state legislature without its prior

place in the legislature of a state with respect to the conduct of any
judge of the Supreme Court or of a high court in the discharge of his
duties. Under the rules of a House(s) of the state legislature, use of
unparliamentary language or unparliamentary conduct of a member is
prohibited.

number of seats fixed for the Legislative Assembly of the Union
territory of Jammu and Kashmir is 107. But, 24 seats fall in the
Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir (PoK). These seats are vacant and are not
to be taken into account for reckoning the total membership of the
Assembly. In addition, the Lieutenant Governor of the Union territory
of Jammu and Kashmir may nominate two members to the Assembly
to give representation to women, if in his opinion, women are not
adequately represented in the Assembly.
34 High Court
In the Indian single integrated judicial system, the high court operates
below the Supreme Court but above the subordinate courts. The judiciary
ina state consists of a high court and a hierarchy of subordinate courts. The
high court occupies the top position in the judicial administration of a state.
The institution of high court originated in India in 1862 when the high
courts were set up at Calcutta, Bombay and Madras1
. In 1866, a fourth high
court was established at Allahabad. In the course of time, each province in
British India came to have its own high court. After 1950, a high court
existing in a province became the high court for the corresponding state.
The Constitution of India provides for a high court for each state, but the
Seventh Amendment Act of 1956 authorised the Parliament to establish a
common high court for two or more states or for two or more states and a
union territory. The territorial jurisdiction of a high court is co-terminus
with the territory of a state. Similarly, the territorial jurisdiction of a
common high court is co-terminus with the territories of the concerned
states and union territory.
At present (2019), there are 25 high courts in the country2
. Out of them,
only three high courts have jurisdiction over more than one state. Among
the nine union territories, Delhi alone has a separate high court (since
1966). The union territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh have a
common high court. The other union territories fall under the jurisdiction of
different state high courts. The Parilament can extend the jurisdiction of a
high court to any union territory or exclude the jurisdiction of a high court
from any union territory.
The name, year of establishment, territorial jurisdiction and seat (with
bench or benches) of all the 25 high courts are mentioned in Table 34.1 at
the end of this chapter.
Articles 214 to 231 in Part VI of the Constitution deal with the
organisation, independence, jurisdiction, powers, procedures and so on of
the high courts.
COMPOSITION AND APPOINTMENT
Every high court (whether exclusive or common) consists of a chief justice
and such other judges as the president may from time to time deem
necessary to appoint. Thus, the Constitution does not specify the strength of
a high court and leaves it to the discretion of the president. Accordingly, the
President determines the strength of a high court from time to time
depending upon its workload.
Appointment of Judges
The judges of a high court are appointed by the President. The chief justice
is appointed by the President after consultation with the chief justice of
India and the governor of the state concerned. For appointment of other
judges, the chief justice of the concerned high court is also consulted. In
case of a common high court for two or more states, the governors of all the
states concerned are consulted by the president.
In the Second Judges case3
(1993), the Supreme Court ruled that no
appointment of a judge of the high court can be made, unless it is in
conformity with the opinion of the chief justice of India. In the Third
Judges case4
(1998), the Supreme Court opined that in case of the
appointment of high court judges, the chief justice of India should consult a
collegium of two senior-most judges of the Supreme Court. Thus, the sole
opinion of the chief justice of India alone does not constitute the
‘consultation’ process.
The 99th Constitutional Amendment Act of 2014 and the National Judicial
Appointments Commission Act of 2014 have replaced the Collegium
System of appointing judges to the Supreme Court and High Courts with a
new body called the National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC).
However, in 2015, the Supreme Court has declared both the 99th
Constitutional Amendment as well as the NJAC Act as unconstitutional and
void. Consequently, the earlier collegium system became operative again.
This verdict was delivered by the Supreme Court in the Fourth Judges case4a
(2015). The Court opined that the new system (i.e., NJAC) would affect the
independence of the judiciary.
QUALIFICATIONS, OATH AND SALARIES
Qualifications of Judges
A person to be appointed as a judge of a high court, should have the
following qualifications:
1.  He should be a citizen of India.
2.  (a)  He should have held a judicial office in the territory of India for
ten years; or
(b)  He should have been an advocate of a high court (or high courts in
succession) for ten years.
From the above, it is clear that the Constitution has not prescribed a
minimum age for appointment as a judge of a high court. Moreover, unlike
in the case of the Supreme Court, the Consitution makes no provision for
appointment of a distinguished jurist as a judge of a high court.
Oath or Affirmation
A person appointed as a judge of a high court, before entering upon his
office, has to make and subscribe an oath or affirmation before the governor
of the state or some person appointed by him for this purpose. In his oath, a
judge of a high court swears:
1.  to bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of India;
2.  to uphold the sovereignty and integrity of India;
3.  to duly and faithfully and to the best of his ability, knowledge and
judgement perform the duties of the office without fear or favour,
affection or ill-will; and
4.  to uphold the Constitution and the laws.
Salaries and Allowances
The salaries, allowances, privileges, leave and pension of the judges of a
high court are determined from time to time by the Parliament. They cannot
be varied to their disadvantage after their appointment except during a
financial emergency. In 2018, the salary of the chief justice was increased
from ₹90,000 to 2.50 lakh per month and that of a judge from ₹80,000 to
2.25 lakh per month6
. They are also paid sumptuary allowance and provided
with free accommodation and other facilities like medical, car, telephone,
etc.
The retired chief justice and judges are entitled to 50% of their last drawn
salary as monthly pension.
TENURE, REMOVAL AND TRANSFER
Tenure of Judges
The Constitution has not fixed the tenure of a judge of a high court.
However, it makes the following four provisions in this regard:
1.  He holds office until he attains the age of 62 years5
. Any questions
regarding his age is to be decided by the president after consultation
with the chief justice of India and the decision of the president is final.
2.  He can resign his office by writing to the president.
3.  He can be removed from his office by the President on the
recommendation of the Parliament.
4.  He vacates his office when he is appointed as a judge of the
Supreme Court or when he is transferred to another high court.
Removal of Judges
A judge of a high court can be removed from his office by an order of the
President. The President can issue the removal order only after an address
by the Parliament has been presented to him in the same session for such
removal. The address must be supported by a special majority of each
House of Parliament (i.e., a majority of the total membership of that House
and majority of not less than two-thirds of the members of that House
present and voting). The grounds of removal are two–proved misbehaviour
or incapacity. Thus, a judge of a high court can be removed in the same
manner and on the same grounds as a judge of the Supreme Court.
The Judges Enquiry Act (1968) regulates the procedure relating to the
removal of a judge of a high court by the process of impeachment:
1.  A removal motion signed by 100 members (in the case of Lok
Sabha) or 50 members (in the case of Rajya Sabha) is to be given to
the Speaker/Chairman.
2.  The Speaker/Chairman may admit the motion or refuse to admit it.
3.  If it is admitted, then the Speaker/ Chairman is to constitute a threemember committee to investigate into the charges.
4.  The committee should consist of (a) the chief justice or a judge of
the Supreme Court, (b) a chief justice of a high court, and (c) a
distinguished jurist.
5.  If the committee finds the judge to be guilty of misbehaviour or
suffering from an incapacity, the House can take up the consideration
of the motion.
6.  After the motion is passed by each House of Parliament by special
majority, an address is presented to the president for removal of the
judge.
7.  Finally, the president passes an order removing the judge.
From the above, it is clear that the procedure for the impeachment of a
judge of a high court is the same as that for a judge of the Supreme Court.
It is interesting to know that no judge of a high court has been impeached
so far.
Transfer of Judges
The President can transfer a judge from one high court to another after
consulting the Chief Justice of India. On transfer, he is entitled to receive in
addition to his salary such compensatory allowance as may be determined
by Parliament.
In 1977, the Supreme Court ruled that the transfer of high court judges
could be resorted to only as an exceptional measure and only in public
interest and not by way of punishment. Again in 1994, the Supreme Court
held that judicial review is necessary to check arbitrariness in transfer of
judges. But, only the judge who is transferred can challenge it.
In the Third Judges case (1998), the Supreme Court opined that in case of
the transfer of high court judges, the Chief Justice of India should consult,
in addition to the collegium of four seniormost judges of the Supreme
Court, the chief justice of the two high courts (one from which the judge is
being transferred and the other receiving him). Thus, the sole opinion of the
chief justice of India does not constitute the ‘consultation’ process.
ACTING, ADDITIONAL AND RETIRED JUDGES
Acting Chief Justice
The President can appoint a judge of a high court as an acting chief justice
of the high court when:
1.  the office of chief justice of the high court is vacant; or
2.  the chief justice of the high court is temporarily absent; or
3.  the chief justice of the high court is unable to perform the duties of
his office.
Additional and Acting Judges
The President can appoint duly qualified persons as additional judges of a
high court for a temporary period not exceeding two years when:
1.  there is a temporary increase in the business of the high court; or
2.  there are arrears of work in the high court.
The President can also appoint a duly qualified person as an acting judge
of a high court when a judge of that high court (other than the chief justice)
is:
1.  unable to perform the duties of his office due to absence or any
other reason; or
2.  appointed to act temporarily as chief justice of that high court.
An acting judge holds office until the permanent judge resumes his
office. However, both the additional or acting judge cannot hold office after
attaining the age of 62 years.
Retired Judges
At any time, the chief justice of a high court of a state can request a retired
judge of that high court or any other high court to act as a judge of the high
court of that state for a temporary period. He can do so only with the
previous consent of the President and also of the person to be so appointed.
Such a judge is entitled to such allowances as the President may determine.
He will also enjoy all the jurisdiction, powers and privileges of a judge of
that high court. But, he will not otherwise be deemed to be a judge of that
high court.
INDEPENDENCE OF HIGH COURT
The independence of a high court is very essential for the effective
discharge of the duties assigned to it. It should be free from the
encroachments, pressures and interferences of the executive (council of
ministers) and the legislature. It should be allowed to do justice without fear
or favour.
The Constitution has made the following provisions to safeguard and
ensure the independent and impartial functioning of a high court.
1. Mode of Appointment
The judges of a high court are appointed by the president (which means the
cabinet) in consultation with the members of the judiciary itself (i.e., chief
justice of India and the chief justice of the high court). This provision
curtails the absolute discretion of the executive as well as ensures that the
judicial appointments are not based on any political or practical
considerations.
2. Security of Tenure
The judges of a high court are provided with the security of tenure. They
can be removed from office by the president only in the manner and on the
grounds mentioned in the Constitution. This means that they do not hold
their office during the pleasure of the president, though they are appointed
by him. This is obvious from the fact that no judge of a high court has been
removed (or impeached) so far.
3. Fixed Service Conditions
The salaries, allowances, privileges, leave and pension of the judges of a
high court are determined from time to time by the Parliament. But, they
cannot be changed to their disadvantage after their appointment except
during a financial emergency. Thus, the conditions of service of the judges
of a high court remain same during their term of office.
4. Expenses Charged on Consolidated Fund
The salaries and allowances of the judges, the salaries, allowances and
pensions of the staff as well as the administrative expenses of a high court
are charged on the consolidated fund of the state. Thus, they are non-
votable by the state legislature (though they can be discussed by it). It
should be noted here that the pension of a high court judge is charged on the
Consolidated Fund of India and not the state.
5. Conduct of Judges cannot be Discussed
The Constitution prohibits any discussion in Parliament or in a state
legislature with respect to the conduct of the judges of a high court in the
discharge of their duties, except when an impeachment motion is under
consideration of the Parliament.
6. Ban on Practice after Retirement
The retired permanent judges of a high court are prohibited from pleading
or acting in any court or before any authority in India except the Supreme
Court and the other high courts. This ensures that they do not favour any
one in the hope of future favour.
7. Power to Punish for its Contempt
A high court can punish any person for its contempt. Thus, its actions and
decisions cannot be criticised and opposed by anybody. This power is
vested in a high court to maintain its authority, dignity and honour.
8. Freedom to Appoint its Staff
The chief justice of a high court can appoint officers and servants of the
high court without any interference from the executive. He can also
prescribe their conditions of service.
9. Its Jurisdiction cannot be Curtailed
The jurisdiction and powers of a high court in so far as they are specified in
the Constitution cannot be curtailed both by the Parliament and the state
legislature. But, in other respects, the jurisdiction and powers of a high
court can be changed both by the parliament and the state legislature.
10. Separation from Executive
The Constitution directs the state to take steps to separate the judiciary from
the executive in public services. This means that the executive authorities
should not possess the judicial powers. Consequent upon its
implementation, the role of executive authorities in judicial administration
came to an end7
 .
JURISDICTION AND POWERS OF HIGH COURT
Like the Supreme Court, the high court has been vested with quite extensive
and effective powers. It is the highest court of appeal in the state. It is the
protector of the Fundamental Rights of the citizens. It is vested with the
power to interpret the Constitution. Besides, it has supervisory and
consultative roles.
However, the Constitution does not contain detailed provisions with
regard to the jurisdiction and powers of a high court. It only lays down that
the jurisdiction and powers of a high court are to be the same as
immediately before the commencement of the Constitution. But, there is
one addition, that is, the Constitution gives a high court jurisdiction over
revenue matters (which it did not enjoy in the pre-con-stitution era). The
Constitution also confers (by other provisions) some more additional
powers on a high court like writ jurisdiction, power of superintendence,
consultative power, etc. Moreover, it empowers the Parliament and the state
legislature to change the jurisdiction and powers of a high court.
At present, a high court enjoys the following jurisdiction and powers:
1.  Original jurisdiction.
2.  Writ jurisdiction.
3.  Appellate jurisdiction.
4.  Supervisory jurisdiction.
5.  Control over subordinate courts.
6.  A court of record.
7.  Power of judicial review.
The present jurisdiction and powers of a high court are governed by (a)
the constitutional provisions, (b) the Letters Patent, (c) the Acts of
Parliament, (d) the Acts of State Legislature, (e) Indian Penal Code, 1860,
(f) Cirminal Procedure Code, 1973, and (g) Civil Procedure Code, 1908.
1. Original Jurisdiction
It means the power of a high court to hear disputes in the first instance, not
by way of appeal. It extends to the following:
(a)  Matters of admirality and contempt of court.
(b)  Disputes relating to the election of members of Parliament and
state legislatures.
(c)  Regarding revenue matter or an act ordered or done in revenue
collection.
(d)  Enforcement of fundamental rights of citizens.
(e)  Cases ordered to be transferred from a subordinate court involving
the interpretation of the Constitution to its own file.
(f)  The four high courts (i.e., Calcutta, Bombay, Madras and Delhi
High Courts) have original civil jurisdiction in cases of higher value.
Before 1973, the Calcutta, Bombay and Madras High Courts also had
original criminal jurisdiction. This was fully abolished by the Criminal
Procedure Code, 1973.
2. Writ Jurisdiction
Article 226 of the Constitution empowers a high court to issue writs
including habeas corpus, mandamus, certiorari, prohibition and quo
warranto for the enforcement of the fundamental rights of the citizens and
for any other purpose. The phrase ‘for any other purpose’ refers to the
enforcement of an ordinary legal right. The high court can issue writs to any
person, authority and government not only within its territorial jurisdiction
but also outside its territorial jurisdiction if the cause of action arises within
its territorial jurisdiction8
 .
The writ jurisdiction of the high court (under Article 226) is not
exclusive but concurrent with the writ jurisdiction of the Supreme Court
(under Article 32). It means, when the fundamental rights of a citizen are
violated, the aggrieved party has the option of moving either the high court
or the Supreme Court directly. However, the writ jurisdiction of the high
court is wider than that of the Supreme Court. This is because, the Supreme
Court can issue writs only for the enforcement of fundamental rights and
not for any other purpose, that is, it does not extend to a case where the
breach of an ordinary legal right is alleged.
In the Chandra Kumar case9
(1997), the Supreme Court ruled that the
writ jurisdiction of both the high court and the Supreme Court constitute a
part of the basic structure of the Constitution. Hence, it cannot be ousted or
excluded even by way of an amendment to the Constitution.
3. Appellate Jurisdiction
A high court is primarily a court of appeal. It hears appeals against the
judgements of subordinate courts functioning in its territorial jurisdiction. It
has appellate jurisdiction in both civil and criminal matters. Hence, the
appellate jurisdiction of a high court is wider than its original jurisdiction.
(a) Civil Matters
The civil appellate jurisdiction of a high court is as follows:
(i) First appeals from the orders and judgements of the district
courts, additional district courts and other subordinate courts lie
directly to the high court, on both questions of law and fact, if the
amount exceeds the stipulated limit.
(ii) Second appeals from the orders and judgements of the district
court or other subordinate courts lie to the high court in the cases
involving questions of law only (and not questions of fact).
(iii) The Calcutta, Bombay and Madras High Courts have provision
for intra-court appeals. When a single judge of the high court has
decided a case (either under the original or appellate jurisdiction
of the high court), an appeal from such a decision lies to the
division bench of the same high court.
(iv) Appeals from the decisions of the administrative and other
tribunals lie to the division bench of the state high court. In 1997,
the Supreme Court ruled that the tribunals are subject to the writ
jurisdiction of the high courts. Consequently, it is not possible for
an aggrieved person to approach the Supreme Court directly
against the decisions of the tribunals, without first going to the
high courts.
(b) Criminal Matters
The criminal appellate jurisdiction of a high court is as follows:
(i) Appeals from the judgements of sessions court and additional
sessions court lie to the high court if the sentence is one of
imprisonment for more than seven years. It should also be noted
here that a death sentence (popularly known as capital
punishment) awarded by a sessions court or an additional sessions
court should be confirmed by the high court before it can be
executed, whether there is an appeal by the convicted person or
not.
(ii) In some cases specified in various provisions of the Criminal
Procedure Code (1973), the appeals from the judgements of the
assistant sessions judge, metropolitan magistrate or other
magistrates (judicial) lie to the high court.
4. Supervisory Jurisdiction
A high court has the power of superintendence over all courts and tribunals
functioning in its territorial jurisdiction (except military courts or tribunals).
Thus, it may–
(a)  call for returns from them;
(b)  make and issue, general rules and prescribe forms for regulating
the practice and proceedings of them;
(c)  prescribe forms in which books, entries and accounts are to be kept
by them; and
(d)  settle the fees payable to the sheriff, clerks, officers and legal
practitioners of them.
This power of superintendence of a high court is very broad because, (i)
it extends to all courts and tribunals whether they are subject to the
appellate jurisdiction of the high court or not; (ii) it covers not only
administrative superintendence but also judicial superintendence; (iii) it is a
revisional jurisdiction; and (iv) it can be suo-motu (on its own) and not
necessarily on the application of a party.
However, this power does not vest the high court with any unlimited
authority over the subordinate courts and tribunals. It is an extraordinary
power and hence has to be used most sparingly and only in appropriate
cases. Usually, it is limited to, (i) excess of jurisdiction, (ii) gross violation
of natural justice, (iii) error of law, (iv) disregard to the law of superior
courts, (v) perverse findings, and (vi) manifest injustice.
5. Control over Subordinate Courts
In addition to its appellate jurisdiction and supervisory jurisdiction over the
subordinate courts as mentioned above, a high court has an administrative
control and other powers over them. These include the following:
(a)  It is consulted by the governor in the matters of appointment,
posting and promotion of district judges and in the appointments of
persons to the judicial service of the state (other than district judges).
(b)  It deals with the matters of posting, promotion, grant of leave,
transfers and discipline of the members of the judicial service of the
state (other than district judges).
(c)  It can withdraw a case pending in a subordinate court if it involves
a substantial question of law that require the interpretation of the
Constitution. It can then either dispose of the case itself or determine
the question of law and return the case to the subordinate court with its
judgement.
(d)  Its law is binding on all subordinate courts functioning within its
territorial jurisdiction in the same sense as the law declared by the
Supreme Court is binding on all courts in India.
6. A Court of Record
As a court of record, a high court has two powers:
(a)  The judgements, proceedings and acts of the high courts are
recorded for perpetual memory and testimony. These records are
admitted to be of evidentiary value and cannot be questioned when
produced before any subordinate court. They are recognised as legal
precedents and legal references.
(b)  It has power to punish for contempt of court, either with simple
imprisonment or with fine or with both.
The expression ‘contempt of court’ has not been defined by the
Constitution. However, the expression has been defined by the Contempt of
Court Act of 1971. Under this, contempt of court may be civil or criminal.
Civil contempt means wilful disobedience to any judgement, order, writ or
other process of a court or wilful breach of an undertaking given to a court.
Criminal contempt means the publication of any matter or doing an act
which–(i) scandalises or lowers the authority of a court; or (ii) prejudices or
interferes with the due course of a judicial proceeding; or (iii) interferes or
obstructs the administration of justice in any other manner.
However, innocent publication and distribution of some matter, fair and
accurate report of judicial proceedings, fair and reasonable criticism of
judicial acts and comment on the administrative side of the judiciary do not
amount to contempt of court.
As a court of record, a high court also has the power to review and
correct its own judgement or order or decision, even though no specific
power of review is conferred on it by the Constitution. The Supreme Court,
on the other hand, has been specifically conferred with the power of review
by the constitution.
7. Power of Judicial Review
Judicial review is the power of a high court to examine the constitutionality
of legislative enactments and executive orders of both the Central and state
governments. On examination, if they are found to be violative of the
Constitution (ultra-vires), they can be declared as illegal, unconstitutional
and invalid (null and void) by the high court. Consequently, they cannot be
enforced by the government.
Though the phrase ‘judicial review’ has no where been used in the
Constitution, the provisions of Articles 13 and 226 explicitly confer the
power of judicial review on a high court. The constitutional validity of a
legislative enactment or an executive order can be challenged in a high
court on the following three grounds:
(a)  it infringes the fundamental rights (Part III),
(b)  it is outside the competence of the authority which has framed it,
and
(c)  it is repugnant to the constitutional provisions.
The 42nd Amendment Act of 1976 curtailed the judicial review power of
high court. It debarred the high courts from considering the constitutional
validity of any central law. However, the 43rd Amendment Act of 1977
restored the original position.

35 Tribunals
The original Constitution did not contain provisions with respect to
tribunals. The 42nd Amendment Act of 1976 added a new Part XIV-A to
the Constitution. This part is entitled as ‘Tribunals’ and consists of only two
Articles–Article 323 A dealing with administrative tribunals and Article
323 B dealing with tribunals for other matters.
ADMINISTRATIVE TRIBUNALS
Article 323 A empowers the Parliament to provide for the establishment of
administrative tribunals for the adjudication of disputes relating to
recruitment and conditions of service of persons appointed to public
services of the Centre, the states, local bodies, public corporations and other
public authorities. In other words, Article 323 A enables the Parliament to
take out the adjudication of disputes relating to service matters from the
civil courts and the high courts and place it before the administrative
tribunals.
In pursuance of Article 323 A, the Parliament has passed the
Administrative Tribunals Act in 1985. The act authorises the Central
government to establish one Central administrative tribunal and the state
administrative tribunals. This act opened a new chapter in the sphere of
providing speedy and inexpensive justice to the aggrieved public servants.
Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT)
The Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) was set up in 1985 with the
principal bench at Delhi and additional benches in different states. At
present, it has 17 regular benches, 15 of which operate at the principal seats
of high courts and the remaining two at Jaipur and Lucknow1
. These
benches also hold circuit sittings at other seats of high courts.
The CAT exercises original jurisdiction in relation to recruitment and all
service matters of public servants covered by it. Its jurisdiction extends to
the all-India services, the Central civil services, civil posts under the Centre
and civilian employees of defence services. However, the members of the
defence forces, officers and servants of the Supreme Court and the
secretarial staff of the Parliament are not covered by it.
The CAT is a multi-member body consisting of a chairman and members.
Originally, the CAT consisted of a Chairman, Vice-Chairman and members.
Later, in 2006, the provision for the Vice-Chairman was removed by the
Administrative Tribunals (Amendment) Act, 2006. Hence, there are now no
Vice-Chairman in the CAT. At present (2019), the sanctioned strength of the
Chairman is one and sanctioned strength of the Members is 65. They are
drawn from both judicial and administrative streams and are appointed by
the president. They hold office for a term of five years or until they attain
the age of 65 years in case of chairman and 62 years in case of members,
whichever is earlier.
The appointment of Members in CAT is made on the basis of
recommendations of a high powered selection committee chaired by a
sitting Judge of Supreme Court who is nominated by the Chief Justice of
India. After obtaining the concurrence of Chief Justice of India,
appointments are made with the approval of Appointments Committee of
the Cabinet (ACC).
The CAT is not bound by the procedure laid down in the Civil Procedure
Code of 1908. It is guided by the principles of natural justice. These
principles keep the CAT flexible in approach. Only a nominal fee of ₹50 is
to be paid by the applicant. The applicant may appear either in person or
through a lawyer.
Originally, appeals against the orders of the CAT could be made only in
the Supreme Court and not in the high courts. However, in the Chandra
Kumar case2
(1997), the Supreme Court declared this restriction on the
jurisdiction of the high courts as unconstitutional, holding that judicial
review is a part of the basic structure of the Constitution. It laid down that
appeals against the orders of the CAT shall lie before the division bench of
the concerned high court. Consequently, now it is not possible for an
aggrieved public servant to approach the Supreme Court directly against an
order of the CAT, without first going to the concerned high court.
State Administrative Tribunals
The Administrative Tribunals Act of 1985 empowers the Central
government to establish the State Administrative Tribunals (SATs) on
specific request of the concerned state governments. So far (2019), the
SATs have been set up in the nine states of Andhra Pradesh, Himachal
Pradesh, Odisha, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu,
West Bengal and Kerala. However, the Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and
Himachal Pradesh Tribunals have since been abolished.
But subsequently, the Himachal Pradesh reestablished the SAT and the
state of Tamil Nadu has also requested now to re-establish the same.
Further, the state government of Haryana has requested to establish the SAT
for their state. On the other hand, the state government of Odisha has
submitted a proposal for abolition of Odisha Administrative Tribunal.
Like the CAT, the SATs exercise original jurisdiction in relation to
recruitment and all service matters of state government employees.
The chairman and members of the SATs are appointed by the president
after consultation with the governor of the state concerned.
The act also makes a provision for setting up of joint administrative
tribunal (JAT) for two or more states. A JAT exercises all the jurisdiction
and powers exercisable by the administrative tribunals for such states.
The chairman and members of a JAT are appointed by the president after
consultation with the governors of the concerned states.
TRIBUNALS FOR OTHER MATTERS
Under Article 323 B, the Parliament and the state legislatures are authorised
to provide for the establishment of tribunals for the adjudication of disputes
relating to the following matters:
(a)  Taxation
(b)  Foreign exchange, import and export
(c)  Industrial and labour
(d)  Land reforms
(e)  Ceiling on urban property
(f)  Elections to Parliament and state legislatures
(g)  Food stuffs
(h)  Rent and tenancy rights3
Articles 323 A and 323 B differs in the following three aspects:
1.  While Article 323 A contemplates establishment of tribunals for
public service matters only, Article 323 B contemplates establishment
of tribunals for certain other matters (mentioned above).
2.  While tribunals under Article 323 A can be established only by
Parliament, tribunals under Article 323 B can be established both by
Parliament and state legislatures with respect to matters falling within
their legislative competence.
3.  Under Article 323 A, only one tribunal for the Centre and one for
each state or two or more states may be established. There is no
question of hierarchy of tribunals, whereas under Article 323 B a
hierarchy of tribunals may be created.
In Chandra Kumar case4
(1997), the Supreme Court declared those
provisions of these two articles which excluded the jurisdiction of the high
courts and the Supreme Court as unconstitutional. Hence, the judicial
remedies are now available against the orders of these tribunals.

36 Subordinate Courts
The state judiciary consists of a high court and a hierarchy of subordinate
courts, also known as lower courts. The subordinate courts are so called
because of their subordination to the state high court. They function below
and under the high court at district and lower levels.
CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS
Articles 233 to 237 in Part VI of the Constitution make the following
provisions to regulate the organization of subordinate courts and to ensure
their independence from the executive1
 .
1. Appointment of District Judges
The appointment, posting and promotion of district judges in a state are
made by the governor of the state in consultation with the high court.
A person to be appointed as district judge should have the following
qualifications:
(a)  He should not already be in the service of the Central or the state
government.
(b)  He should have been an advocate or a pleader for seven years.
(c)  He should be recommended by the high court for appointment.
2. Appointment of District Judges
Appointment of persons (other than district judges) to the judicial service of
a state are made by the governor of the state after consultation with the
State Public Service Commission and the high court2
 .
3. Control over Subordinate Courts
The control over district courts and other subordinate courts including the
posting, promotion and leave of persons belonging to the judicial service of
a state and holding any post inferior to the post of district judge is vested in
the high court.
4. Interpretation
The expression ‘district judge’ includes judge of a city civil court,
additional district judge, joint district judge, assistant district judge, chief
judge of a small cause court, chief presidency magistrate, additional chief
presidency magistrate, sessions judge, additional sessions judge and
assistant sessions judge.
The expression ‘judicial service’ means a service consisting exclusively
of persons intended to fill the post of district judge and other civil judicial
posts inferior to the post of district judge.
5. Application of the above Provisions to Certain Magistrates
The Governor may direct that the above mentioned provisions relating to
persons in the state judicial service would apply to any class or classes of
magistrates in the state.
STRUCTURE AND JURISDICTION
The organisational structure, jurisdiction and nomenclature of the
subordinate judiciary are laid down by the states. Hence, they differ slightly
from state to state. Broadly speaking, there are three tiers of civil and
criminal courts below the High Court. This is shown as follows:
The district judge is the highest judicial authority in the district. He
possesses original and appellate jurisdiction in both civil as well as criminal
matters. In other words, the district judge is also the sessions judge. When
he deals with civil cases, he is known as the district judge and when he
hears the criminal cases, he is called as the sessions judge. The district
judge exercises both judicial and administrative powers. He also has
supervisory powers over all the subordinate courts in the district. Appeals
against his orders and judgements lie to the High Court. The sessions judge
has the power to impose any sentence including life imprisonment and
capital punishment (death sentence). However, a capital punishment passed
by him is subject to confirmation by the High Court, whether there is an
appeal or not.
Below the District and Sessions Court stands the Court of Subordinate
Judge on the civil side and the Court of Chief Judicial Magistrate on the
criminal side. The subordinate judge exercises unlimited pecuniary
jurisdiction over civil suits3
. The chief judicial magistrate decides criminal
cases which are punishable with imprisonment for a term up to seven years.
At the lowest level, on the civil side, is the Court of Munsiff and on the
criminal side, is the Court of Judicial Magistrate. The munsiff possesses
limited jurisdiction and decides civil cases of small pecuniary stake4
. The
judicial magistrate tries criminal cases which are punishable with
imprisonment for a term up to three years.
In some metropolitan cities, there are city civil courts (chief judges) on
the civil side and the courts of metropolitan magistrates on the criminal
side.
Some of the States and Presidency towns have established small causes
courts5
. These courts decide the civil cases of small value in a summary
manner. Their decisions are final, but the High Court possesses a power of
revision.
In some states, Panchayat Courts try petty civil and criminal cases. They
are variously known as Nyaya Panchayat, Gram Kutchery, Adalati
Panchayat, Panchayat Adalat and so on.

NATIONAL LEGAL SERVICES AUTHORITY6
Article 39A of the Constitution of India provides for free legal aid to the
poor and weaker sections of the society and ensures justice for all. Articles
14 and 22(1) of the Constitution also make it obligatory for the State to
ensure equality before law and a legal system which promotes justice on the
basis of equal opportunity to all. In the year 1987, the Legal Services
Authorities Act was enacted by the Parliament which came into force on 9
th
November, 1995 to establish a nationwide uniform network for providing
free and competent legal services to the weaker sections of the society on
the basis of equal opportunity. The National Legal Services Authority
(NALSA) has been constituted under the Legal Services Authorities Act,
1987 to monitor and evaluate implementation of legal aid programmes and
to lay down policies and principles for making legal services available
under the Act.
In every State, a State Legal Services Authority and in every High Court,
a High Court Legal Services Committee have been constituted. The District
Legal Services Authorities, Taluk Legal Services Committees have been
constituted in the Districts and most of the Taluks to give effect to the
policies and directions of the NALSA and to provide free legal services to
the people and conduct Lok Adalats in the State.
The Supreme Court Legal Services Committee has been constituted to
administer and implement the legal services programme insofar as it relates
to the Supreme Court of India.
The NALSA lays down policies, principles, guidelines and frames
effective and economical schemes for the State Legal Services Authorities
to implement the Legal Services Programmes throughout the country.
Primarily, the State Legal Services Authorities, District Legal Services
Authorities, Taluk Legal Services Committees, etc. have been asked to
discharge the following main functions on regular basis:
1.  To provide free and competent legal services to the eligible persons.
2.  To organise Lok Adalats for amicable settlement of disputes.
3.  To organise legal awareness camps in the rural areas.
The free legal services include:
(a)  Payment of court fee, process fees and all other charges payable or
incurred in connection with any legal proceedings.
(b)  Providing service of lawyers in legal proceedings.
(c)  Obtaining and supply of certified copies of orders and other
documents in legal proceedings.
(d)  Preparation of appeal, paper book including printing and
translation of documents in legal proceedings.
The persons eligible for getting free legal services include:
(i) Women and children
(ii) Members of SC/ST
(iii) Industrial workmen
(iv) Victims of mass disaster, violence, f lood, drought,
earthquake, industrial disaster
(v) Disabled persons
(vi) Persons in custody
(vii) Persons whose annual income does not exceed ₹1 lakh (in
the Supreme Court Legal Services Committee the limit is
₹1,25,000/-)
(viii) Victims of trafficking in human beings or begar.
LOK ADALATS
The Lok Adalat is a forum where the cases (or disputes) which are pending
in a court or which are at pre-litigation stage (not yet brought before a
court) are compromised or settled in an amicable manner.
Meaning
The Supreme Court has explained the meaning of the institution of Lok
Adalat in the following way7
 :
The ‘Lok Adalat’ is an old form of adjudicating system prevailed in
ancient India and it’s validity has not been taken away even in the modern
days too. The word ‘Lok Adalat’ means ‘People’s Court’. This system is
based on Gandhian principles. It is one of the components of ADR
(Alternative Dispute Resolution) system. As the Indian courts are
overburdened with the backlog of cases and the regular courts are to decide
the cases involving a lengthy, expensive and tedious procedure. The court
takes years together to settle even petty cases. The Lok Adalat, therefore,
provides alternative resolution or devise for expeditious and inexpensive
justice.
In Lok Adalat proceedings, there are no victors and vanquished and, thus,
no rancour.
The experiment of ‘Lok Adalat’ as an alternate mode of dispute
settlement has come to be accepted in India, as a viable, economic, efficient
and informal one.
The Lok Adalat is another alternative in judicial justice. This is a recent
strategy for delivering informal, cheap and expeditious justice to the
common man by way of settling disputes, which are pending in courts and
also those, which have not yet reached courts by negotiation, conciliation
and by adopting persuasive, common sense and human approach to the
problems of the disputants, with the assistance of specially trained and
experienced members of a team of conciliators.
Statutory Status
The first Lok Adalat camp in the postindependence era was organised in
Gujarat in 1982. This initiative proved very successful in the settlement of
disputes. Consequently, the institution of Lok Adalat started spreading to
other parts of the country. At that time, this institution was functioning as a
voluntary and conciliatory agency without any statutory backing for its
decisions. In view of its growing popularity, there arose a demand for
providing a statutory backing to this institution and the awards given by
Lok Adalats. Hence, the institution of Lok Adalat has been given statutory
status under the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987.
The Act makes the following provisions relating to the organisation and
functioning of the Lok Adalats:
1.  The State Legal Services Authority or the District Legal Services
Authority or the Supreme Court Legal Services Committee or the High
Court Legal Services Committee or the Taluk Legal Services
Committee may organise Lok Adalats at such intervals and places and
for exercising such jurisdiction and for such areas as it thinks fit.
2.  Every Lok Adalat organised for an area shall consist of such
number of serving or retired judicial officers and other persons of the
area as may be specified by the agency organizing such Lok Adalat.
Generally, a Lok Adalat consists of a judicial officer as the chairman
and a lawyer (advocate) and a social worker as members.
3.  A Lok Adalat shall have jurisdiction to determine and to arrive at a
compromise or settlement between the parties to a dispute in respect
of:
(i) any case pending before any court; or
(ii) any matter which is falling within the jurisdiction of any
court and is not brought before such court.
Thus, the Lok Adalat can deal with not only the cases pending
before a court but also with the disputes at pre-litigation stage.
The various matters such as Matri-monial/Family Disputes,
Criminal (Compoundable Offences) cases, Land Acquisition cases,
Labour disputes, Workmen’s compensation cases, Bank Recovery
cases, Pension cases, Housing Board and Slum Clearance cases,
Housing Finance cases, Consumer Grievance cases, Electricity
matters, Disputes relating to Telephone Bills, Municipal matters
including House Tax cases, Disputes with Cellular Companies etc. are
being taken up in the Lok Adalats.7a
But, the Lok Adalat shall have no jurisdiction in respect of any case
or matter relating to an offence not compoundable under any law. In
other words, the offences which are non-compoundable under any law
fall outside the purview of the Lok Adalat.
4.  Any case pending before the court can be referred to the Lok Adalat
for settlement if:
(i) the parties thereof agree to settle the dispute in the Lok
Adalat; or
(ii) one of the parties thereof makes an application to the court,
for referring the case to the Lok Adalat; or
(iii) the court is satisfied that the matter is an appropriate one to
be taken cognizance of by the Lok Adalat.
In the case of a pre-litigation dispute, the matter can be referred to
the Lok Adalat for settlement by the agency organizing the Lok
Adalat, on receipt of an application from any one of the parties to the
dispute.
5.  The Lok Adalat shall have the same powers as are vested in a Civil
Court under the Code of Civil Procedure (1908), while trying a suit in
respect of the following matters:
(a)  the summoning and enforcing the attendance of any witness
examining him on oath;
(b)  the discovery and production of any document;
(c)  the reception of evidence on affidavits;
(d)  the requisitioning of any public record or document from any court
or office; and
(e)  such other matters as may be prescribed.
Further, a Lok Adalat shall have the requisite powers to specify its
own procedure for the determination of any dispute coming before it.
Also, all proceedings before a Lok Adalat shall be deemed to be
judicial proceedings within the meaning of the Indian Penal Code
(1860) and every Lok Adalat shall be deemed to be a Civil Court for
the purpose of the Code of Criminal Procedure (1973).
6.  An award of a Lok Adalat shall be deemed to be a decree of a Civil
Court or an order of any other court. Every award made by a Lok
Adalat shall be final and binding on all the parties to the dispute. No
appeal shall lie to any court against the award of the Lok Adalat.
Benefits
According to the Supreme Court, the benefits under Lok Adalat are as
follows8
 :
1.  There is no court fee and if court fee is already paid the amount will
be refunded if the dispute is settled at Lok Adalat.
2.  The basic features of Lok Adalat are the procedural f lexibility and
speedy trial of the disputes. There is no strict application of procedural
laws like the Civil Procedure Code and the Evidence Act while
assessing the claim by Lok Adalat.
3.  The parties to the dispute can directly interact with the judge
through their counsel which is not possible in regular courts of law.
4.  The award by the Lok Adalat is binding on the parties and it has the
status of a decree of a civil court and it is non-appealable, which does
not cause the delay in the settlement of disputes finally.
In view of above facilities provided by the Act, Lok Adalats are boon to
the litigating public as they can get their disputes settled fast and free of
cost amicably.
The Law Commission of India summarized the advantages of ADR
(Alternative Dispute Resolution) in the following way9
 :
1.  It is less expensive.
2.  It is less time-consuming.
3.  It is free from technicalities vis-a-vis conducting of cases in law
courts.
4.  Parties are free to discuss their differences of opinion without any
fear of disclosure before any law courts.
5.  Parties have the feeling that there is no losing or winning side
between them but at the same time their grievance is redressed and
their relationship is restored.
PERMANENT LOK ADALATS
The Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987 was amended in 2002 to provide
for the establishment of the Permanent Lok Adalats to deal with cases
pertaining to the public utility services.
Reasons
The reasons for the establishment of Permanent Lok Adalats are as follows:
1.  The Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987 was enacted to constitute
legal services authorities for providing free and competent legal
services to the weaker sections of the society to ensure that
opportunities for securing justice were not denied to any citizen by
reason of economic or other disabilities and to organise Lok Adalats to
ensure that the operation of the legal system promotes justice on a
basis of equal opportunity.
2.  The system of Lok Adalat, which is an innovative mechanism for
alternate dispute resolution, has proved effective for resolving disputes
in a spirit of conciliation outside the courts.
3.  However, the major drawback in the existing scheme of
organization of the Lok Adalats under the said Act is that the system of
Lok Adalats is mainly based on compromise or settlement between the
parties. If the parties do not arrive at any compromise or settlement,
the case is either returned to the court of law or the parties are advised
to seek remedy in a court of law. This causes unnecessary delay in the
dispensation of justice. If Lok Adalats are given power to decide the
cases on merits in case parties fails to arrive at any compromise or
settlement, this problem can be tackled to a great extent.
4.  Further, the cases which arise in relation to public utility services
such as Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited, Delhi Vidyut Board,
etc., need to be settled urgently so that people get justice without delay
even at pre-litigation stage and thus most of the petty cases which
ought not to go in the regular courts would be settled at the prelitigation stage itself which would result in reducing the workload of
the regular courts to a great extent.
5.  It is, therefore, proposed to amend the Legal Services Authorities
Act, 1987 to set up Permanent Lok Adalats for providing compulsory
pre-litigative mechanism for conciliation and settlement of cases
relating to public utility services.
Features
The salient features of the new institution of Permanent Lok Adalats are as
follows:
1.  The Permanent Lok Adalat shall consist of a Chairman who is or
has been a district judge or additional district judge or has held judicial
office higher in rank than that of the district judge and two other
persons having adequate experience in public utility services.
2.  The Permanent Lok Adalat shall exercise jurisdiction in respect of
one or more public utility services such as transport services of
passengers or goods by air, road and water; postal, telegraph or
telephone services; supply of power, light or water to the public by any
establishment; public conservancy or sanitation; services in hospitals
or dispensaries; and insurance services.
3.  The pecuniary jurisdiction of the Permanent Lok Adalat shall be up
to rupees ten lakhs. However, the Central Government may increase
the said pecuniary jurisdiction from time to time.
4.  The Permanent Lok Adalat shall have not jurisdiction in respect of
any matter relating to an offence not compoundable under any law.
5.  Before the dispute is brought before any court, any party to the
dispute may make an application to the Permanent Lok Adalat for
settlement of the dispute. After an application is made to the
Permanent Lok Adalat, no party to that application shall invoke
jurisdiction of any court in the same dispute.
6.  Where it appears to the Permanent Lok Adalat that there exist
elements of a settlement, which may be acceptable to the parties, it
shall formulate the terms of a possible settlement and submit them to
the parties for their observations and in case the parties reach an
agreement, the Permanent Lok Adalat shall pass an award in terms
thereof. In case parties to the dispute fail to reach an agreement, the
Permanent Lok Adalat shall decide the dispute on merits.
7.  Every award made by the Permanent Lok Adalat shall be final and
binding on all the parties thereto and shall be by a majority of the
persons constituting the Permanent Lok Adalat.
FAMILY COURTS
The Family Courts Act, 1984 was enacted to provide for the establishment
of Family Courts with a view to promote conciliation and secure speedy
settlement of disputes relating to marriage and family affairs.
Reasons
The reasons for the establishment of separate Family Courts are as follows:
1.  Several associations of women, other organizations and individuals
have urged, from time to time, that Family Courts, be set up for the
settlement of family disputes, where emphasis should be laid on
conciliation and achieving socially desirable results and adherence to
rigid rules of procedure and evidence should be eliminated.
2.  The Law Commission in its 59
th
report (1974) had also stressed that
in dealing with disputes concerning the family the Court ought to
adopt an approach radically different from the adopted in ordinary civil
proceedings and that it should make reasonable efforts at settlement
before the commencement of the trial. The Code of Civil Procedure
was amended in 1976 to provide for a special procedure to be adopted
in suits or proceedings relating to matters concerning the family.
3.  However, not much use has been made by the Courts in adopting
this conciliatory procedure and the Courts continue to deal with family
disputes in the same manner as other civil matters and the same
adversary approach prevails. The need was, therefore, felt, in the
public interest, to establish Family Courts for speedy settlement of
family disputes.
Therefore, the main objectives and reasons for setting up of Family
Courts are:10
(i) To create a Specialized Court which will exclusively deal
with family matters so that such a court may have the
necessary expertise to deal with these cases expeditiously.
Thus expertise and expeditious disposal are two main factors
for establishing such a court;
(ii) To institute a mechanism for conciliation of the disputes
relating to family;
(iii) To provide an inexpensive remedy; and
(iv) To have f lexibility and an informal atmosphere in the
conduct of proceedings.
Features
The salient features of the Family Courts Act, 1984 are as follows:
1.  It provides for the establishment of Family Courts by the State
Governments in consultation with the High Courts.
2.  It makes it obligatory on the State Governments to set up a Family
Court in every city or town with a population exceeding one million.
3.  It enables the State Governments to set up Family Courts in other
areas also, if they deem it necessary.
4.  It exclusively provides within the jurisdiction of the Family Courts
the matters relating to:
(i) matrimonial relief, including nullity of marriage, judicial
separation, divorce, restitution of conjugal rights, or
declaration as to the validity of marriage or as to the
matrimonial status of any person;
(ii) the property of the spouses or of either of them;
(iii) declaration as to the legitimacy of any person;
(iv) guardianship of a person or the custody of any minor; and
(v) maintenance of wife, children and parents.
5.  It makes it obligatory on the part of the Family Court to endeavour,
in the first instance to effect a reconciliation or a settlement between
the parties to a family dispute. During this stage, the proceedings will
be informal and rigid rules of procedure shall not apply.
6.  It provides for the association of social welfare agencies,
counsellors, etc., during conciliation stage and also to secure the
service of medical and welfare experts.
7.  It provides that the parties to a dispute before a Family Court shall
not be entitled, as of right, to be represented by legal practitioner.
However, the Court may, in the interest of justice, seek assistance of a
legal expert as amicus curiae.
8.  It simplifies the rules of evidence and procedure so as to enable a
Family Court to deal effectively with a dispute.
9.  It provides for only one right of appeal which shall lie to the High
Court.
GRAM NYAYALAYAS
The Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008 has been enacted to provide for the
establishment of the Gram Nyayalayas at the grass roots level for the
purposes of providing access to justice to the citizens at their doorsteps and
to ensure that opportunities for securing justice are not denied to any citizen
due to social, economic or other disabilities.
Reasons
The reasons for the establishment of Gram Nyayalayas are as follows:
1.  Access to justice by the poor and disadvantaged remains a
worldwide problem despite diverse approaches and strategies that have
been formulated and implemented to address it. In our country, Article
39A of the Constitution directs the State to secure that the operation of
the legal system promotes justice, on a basis of equal opportunity and
shall provide free legal aid to ensure that opportunities for securing
justice are not denied to any citizen by reason of economic or other
disabilities.
2.  In the recent past, the Government has taken various measures to
strengthen judicial system, inter alia, by simplifying the procedural
laws; incorporating various alternative dispute resolution mechanisms
such as arbitration, conciliation and mediation; conducting of Lok
Adalats, etc. These measures are required to be strengthened further.
3.  The Law Commission of India in its 114th Report on Gram
Nyayalaya suggested establishment of Gram Nyayalayas so that
speedy, inexpensive and substantial justice could be provided to the
common man. The Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008 is broadly based on
the recommendations of the Law Commission.
4.  Justice to the poor at their door step is a dream of the poor. Setting
up of Gram Nyayalayas in the rural areas would bring to the people of
rural areas speedy, affordable and substantial justice.
Features
The salient features of the Gram Nyayalayas Act are as follows11
 :
1.  The Gram Nyayalaya shall be court of Judicial Magistrate of the
first class and its presiding officer (Nyayadhikari) shall be appointed
by the State Government in consultation with the High Court.
2.  The Gram Nyayalaya shall be established for every Panchayat at
intermediate level or a group of contiguous Panchayats at intermediate
level in a district or where there is no Panchayat at intermediate level
in any State, for a group of contiguous Panchayats.
3.  The Nyayadhikaris who will preside over these Gram Nyayalayas
are strictly judicial officers and will be drawing the same salary,
deriving the same powers as First Class Magistrates working under
High Courts.
4.  The Gram Nyayalaya shall be a mobile court and shall exercise the
powers of both Criminal and Civil Courts.
5.  The seat of the Gram Nyayalaya will be located at the headquarters

dispose of the cases.
6.  The Gram Nyayalaya shall try criminal cases, civil suits, claims or
disputes which are specified in the First Schedule and the Second
Schedule to the Act.
7.  The Central as well as the State Governments have been given
power to amend the First Schedule and the Second Schedule of the
Act, as per their respective legislative competence.
8.  The Gram Nyayalaya shall follow summary procedure in criminal
trial.
9.  The Gram Nyayalaya shall exercise the powers of a Civil Court
with certain modifications and shall follow the special procedure as
provided in the Act.

possible by bringing about conciliation between the parties and for this
purpose, it shall make use of the conciliators to be appointed for this
purpose.
11.  The judgment and order passed by the Gram Nyayalaya shall be
deemed to be a decree and to avoid delay in its execution, the Gram
Nyayalaya shall follow summary procedure for its execution.
12.  The Gram Nyayalaya shall not be bound by the rules of evidence
provided in the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 but shall be guided by the
principles of natural justice and subject to any rule made by the High

heard and disposed of within a period of six months from the date of
filing of the appeal.
15.  A person accused of an offence may file an application for plea

Establishment
The Central Government has decided to meet the non-recurring expenditure
on the establishment of these Gram Nyayalayas subject to a ceiling of
₹18.00 lakhs out of which ₹10.00 lakhs is for construction of the court,
₹5.00 lakhs for vehicle and ₹3.00 lakhs for office equipment.
More than 5000 Gram Nyayalayas are expected to be set up under the
Act for which the Central Government would provide about ₹1400 crores
by way of assistance to the concerned States/Union Territories.
Under of the Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008, it is for the State Governments
to establish Gram Nyayalayas in consultation with the respective High
Courts.
Majority of States have now set up regular courts at Taluka level. Further,
reluctance of police officials and other State functionaries to invoke
jurisdiction of Gram Nyayalayas, lukewarm response of the Bar, nonavailability of notaries and stamp vendors, problem of concurrent
jurisdiction of regular courts are other issues indicated by the States which
are coming in the way of operationalization of the Gram Nyayalayas.
The issues affecting operationalization of the Gram Nyayalayas were
discussed in the Conference of Chief Justices of High Courts and Chief
Ministers of the States in April, 2013. It was decided in the Conference that
the State Government and High Court should decide the question of
establishment of Gram Nyayalayas wherever feasible, taking into account
their local problems. The focus is on setting up Gram Nayayalayas in the
Talukas where regular courts have not been set up.

LOCAL GOVERNMENT
38. Panchayati Raj
39. Municipalities
38 Panchayati Raj
The term Panchayati Raj in India signifies the system of rural local
selfgovernment. It has been established in all the states of India by the Acts
of the state legislatures to build democracy at the grass root level1
. It is
entrusted with rural development. It was constitutionalised through the 73rd
Constitutional Amendment Act of 1992.
EVOLUTION OF PANCHAYATI RAJ
Balwant Rai Mehta Committee
In January 1957, the Government of India appointed a committee to
examine the working of the Community Development Programme (1952)
and the National Extension Service (1953) and to suggest measures for their
better working. The chairman of this committee was Balwant Rai G Mehta.
The committee submitted its report in November 1957 and recommended
the establishment of the scheme of ‘democratic decentralisation’, which
ultimately came to be known as Panchayati Raj. The specific
recommendations made by it are:
1.  Establishment of a three-tier panchayati raj system–gram panchayat
at the village level, panchayat samiti at the block level and zila
parishad at the district level. These tiers should be organically linked
through a device of indirect elections.
2.  The village panchayat should be constituted with directly elected
representatives, whereas the panchayat samiti and zila parishad should
be constituted with indirectly elected members.
3.  All planning and development activities should be entrusted to
these bodies.
4.  The panchayat samiti should be the executive body while the zila
parishad should be the advisory, coordinating and supervisory body.
5.  The district collector should be the chairman of the zila parishad.
6.  There should be a genuine transfer of power and responsibility to
these democratic bodies.
7.  Adequate resources should be transferred to these bodies to enable
them to discharge their functions and fulfil their responsibilities.
8.  A system should be evolved to effect further devolution of authority
in future.
These recommendations of the committee were accepted by the National
Development Council in January 1958. The council did not insist on a
single rigid pattern and left it to the states to evolve their own patterns
suitable to local conditions. But the basic principles and broad fundamentals
should be identical throughout the country.
Rajasthan was the first state to establish Panchayati Raj. The scheme
was inaugurated by the prime minister on October 2, 1959, in Nagaur
district. Rajasthan was followed by Andhra Pradesh, which also adopted the
system in 1959. Thereafter, most of the states adopted the system.
Though most of the states created panchayati raj institutions by mid
1960s, there were differences from one state to another with regard to the
number of tiers, relative position of samiti and parishad, their tenure,
composition, functions, finances and so on. For example, Rajasthan adopted
the three-tier system while Tamil Nadu adopted the two-tier system. West
Bengal, on the other hand, adopted the four-tier system. Further, in the
Rajasthan-Andhra Pradesh pattern, panchayat samiti was powerful as the
block was the unit of planning and development, while in MaharashtraGujarat pattern, zila parishad was powerful as the district was the unit of
planning and development. Some states also established nyaya panchayats,
that is, judicial panchayats to try petty civil and criminal cases.
Study Teams and Committees
Since 1960, many study teams, committees and working groups have been
appointed to examine the various aspects of functioning of Panchayati Raj
system. They are mentioned below in Table 38.1.

Ashok Mehta Committee
In December 1977, the Janata Government appointed a committee on
panchayati raj institutions under the chairmanship of Ashok Mehta. It
submitted its report in August 1978 and made 132 recommendations to
revive and strengthen the declining panchayati raj system in the country. Its
main recommendations were:
1.  The three-tier system of panchayati raj should be replaced by the
two-tier system, that is, zila parishad at the district level, and below it,
the mandal panchayat consisting of a group of villages with a total
population of 15,000 to 20,000.
2.  A district should be the first point for decentralisation under
popular supervision below the state level.
3.  Zila parishad should be the executive body and made responsible
for planning at the district level.
4.  There should be an official participation of political parties at all
levels of panchayat elections.
5.  The panchayati raj institutions should have compulsory powers of
taxation to mobilise their own financial resources.
6.  There should be a regular social audit by a district level agency and
by a committee of legislators to check whether the funds allotted for
the vulnerable social and economic groups are actually spent on them.
7.  The state government should not supersede the panchayati raj
institutions. In case of an imperative supersession, elections should be
held within six months from the date of supersession.
8.  The nyaya panchayats should be kept as separate bodies from that
of development panchayats. They should be presided over by a
qualified judge.
9.  The chief electoral officer of a state in consultation with the chief
election commissioner should organise and conduct the panchayati raj
elections.
10.  Development functions should be transferred to the zila parishad
and all development staff should work under its control and
supervision.
11.  The voluntary agencies should play an important role in
mobilising the support of the people for panchayati raj.
12.  A minister for panchayati raj should be appointed in the state
council of ministers to look after the affairs of the panchayati raj
institutions.
13.  Seats for SCs and STs should be reserved on the basis of their
population.
14.  A constitutional recognition should be accorded to the Panchayati
Raj institutions. This would give them the requisite status (sanctity and
stature) and an assurance of continuous functioning.
Due to the collapse of the Janata Government before the completion of
its term, no action could be taken on the recommendations of the Ashok
Mehta Committee at the central level. However, the three states of
Karnataka, West Bengal and Andhra Pradesh took steps to revitalise the
panchayati raj, keeping in view some of the recommendations of the Ashok
Mehta Committee.
G.V.K. Rao Committee
The Committee to review the existing Administrative Arrangements for
Rural Development and Poverty Alleviation Programmes under the
chairmanship of G.V.K. Rao was appointed by the Planning Commission in
1985. The Committee came to conclusion that the developmental process
was gradually bureaucratised and divorced from the Panchayati Raj. This
phenomena of bureaucratisation of development administration as against
the democratisation weakened the Panchayati Raj institutions resulting in
what is aptly called as ‘grass without roots’. Hence, the Committee made
the following recommendations to strengthen and revitalise the Panchayati
Raj system:
(i) The district level body, that is, the Zila Parishad should be of
pivotal importance in the scheme of democratic decentralisation.
It stated that “the district is the proper unit for planning and
development and the Zila Parishad should become the principal
body for management of all development programmes which can
be handled at that level.”
(ii) The Panchayati Raj institutions at the district and lower levels
should be assigned an important role with respect to planning,
implementation and monitoring of rural development
programmes.
(iii) Some of the planning functions at the state level should be
transferred to the district level planning units for effective
decentralized district planning.
(iv) A post of District Development Commissioner should be created.
He should act as the chief executive officer of the Zila Parishad
and should be in charge of all the development departments at the
district level.
(v) Elections to the Panchayati Raj institutions should be held
regularly. It found that elections became overdue for one or more
tiers in 11 states.
Thus the committee, in its scheme of decentralised system of field
administration, assigned a leading role to the Panchayati Raj in local
planning and development. It is in this respect that the recommendation of
the G.V.K. Rao Committee Report (1986) differed from those of the
Dantwala Committee Report on Block-Level Planning (1978) and the
Hanumantha Rao Committee Report on District Planning (1984). Both the
committees have suggested that the basic decentralised planning function
should be done at the district level. The Hanumantha Rao Committee
advocated separate district planning bodies under either the District
Collector or a minister. In both the models, the Collector should play a
significant role in the decentralised planning though the Committee stated
that Panchayati Raj institutions would also be associated with this process
(of decentralised planning). The committee recommended that the Collector
should be the coordinator, at the district level, of all developmental and
planning activities. Thus the, Hanumantha Rao Committee differed in this
respect from those of Balwantray Mehta Committee, the Administrative
Reforms Commission of India, the Ashok Mehta Committee and finally the
G.V.K. Rao Committee which recommended reduction in the
developmental role of the District Collector and which assigned a major
role to the Panchayati Raj in development administration.
L M Singhvi Committee
In 1986, Rajiv Gandhi government appointed a committee to prepare a
concept paper on ‘Revitalisation of Panchayati Raj Institutions for
Democracy and Development’ under the chairmanship of L.M. Singhvi. It
made the following recommendations.
(i) The Panchayati Raj institutions should be constitutionally
recognised, protected and preserved. For this purpose, a new
chapter should be added in the Constitution of India. This will
make their identity and integrity reasonably and substantially
inviolate. It also suggested constitutional provisions to ensure
regular, free and fair elections to the Panchayati Raj bodies.
(ii) Nyaya Panchayats should be established for a cluster of villages.
(iii) The villages should be reorganised to make Gram Panchayats
more viable. It also emphasised the importance of the Gram
Sabha and called it as the embodiment of direct democracy.
(iv) The Village Panchayats should have more financial resources.
(v) The judicial tribunals should be established in each state to
adjudicate controversies about election to the Panchayati Raj
institutions, their dissolution and other matters related to their
functioning.
Thungon Committee
In 1988, a sub-committee of the Consultative Committee of Parliament was
constituted under the chairmanship of P.K. Thungon to examine the
political and administrative structure in the district for the purpose of
district planning. This committee suggested for the strengthening of the
Panchayati Raj system. It made the following recommendations:
1.  The Panchayati Raj bodies should be constitutionally recognized.
2.  A three-tier system of Panchayati Raj with panchayats at the
village, block and district levels.
3.  Zilla Parishad should be the pivot of the Panchayati Raj system. It
should act as the planning and development agency in the district.
4.  The Panchayati Raj bodies should have a fixed tenure of five years.
5.  The maximum period of super session of a body should be six
months.
6.  A planning and co-ordination committee should be set-up at the
state level under the chairmanship of the minister for planning. The
presidents of Zilla Parishads should be its members.
7.  A detailed list of subjects for Panchayati Raj should be prepared
and incorporated in the Constitution.
8.  Reservation of seats in all the three-tiers should be on the basis of
population. There should also be reservation for women.
9.  A state finance commission should be set-up in each state. It would
lay down the criteria and guidelines for the devolution of finances to
the Panchayati Raj institutions.
10.  The district collector should be the chief executive officer of the
Zilla Parishad.
Gadgil Committee
The Committee on Policy and Programmes was constituted in 1988 by the
Congress party under the chairmanship of V.N. Gadgil. This committee was
asked to consider the question of “how best Panchayati Raj institutions
could be made effective”. In this context, the committee made the following
recommendations:
1.  A constitutional status should be bestowed on the Panchayati Raj
institutions.
2.  A three-tier system of Panchayati Raj with panchayats at the
village, block and district levels.
3.  The term of Panchayati Raj institutions should be fixed at five
years.
4.  The members of the Panchayats at all the three levels should be
directly elected.
5.  Reservation for SCs, STs and women.
6.  The Panchayati Raj bodies should have the responsibility of
preparation and implementation of plans for socioeconomic
development. For this purpose, a list of subjects should be specified in
the constitution.
7.  The Panchayat Raj bodies should be empowered to levy, collect and
appropriate taxes and duties.
8.  Establishment of a State Finance Commission for the allocation of
finances to the Panchayats.
9.  Establishment of a State Election Commission for the conduction of
elections to the panchayats.
The above recommendations of the Gadgil Committee became the basis
for drafting an amendment bill aimed at conferring the constitutional status
and protection to the Panchayati Raj institutions.
Constitutionalisation
Rajiv Gandhi Government
The Rajiv Gandhi Government introduced the 64th Constitutional
Amendment Bill in the Lok Sabha in July 1989 to constitutionalise
panchayati raj institutions and make them more powerful and broad based.
Although, the Lok Sabha passed the bill in August 1989, it was not
approved by the Rajya Sabha. The bill was vehemently opposed by the
Opposition on the ground that it sought to strengthen centralisation in the
federal system.
V.P. Singh Government
The National Front Government, soon after assuming office in November
1989 under the Prime Ministership of V.P. Singh, announced that it would
take steps to strengthen the panchayati raj institutions. In June 1990, a twoday conference of the state chief ministers under the chairmanship of V.P.
Singh was held to discuss the issues relating to the strengthening of the
panchayati raj bodies. The conference approved the proposals for the
introduction of a fresh constitutional amendment bill. Consequently, a
constitutional amendment bill was introduced in the Lok Sabha in
September 1990. However, the fall of the government resulted in the lapse
of the bill.
Narasimha Rao Government
The Congress Government under the prime ministership of P.V. Narasimha
Rao once again considered the matter of the constitutionalisation of
panchayati raj bodies. It drastically modified the proposals in this regard to
delete the controversial aspects and introduced a constitutional amendment
bill in the Lok Sabha in September, 1991. This bill finally emerged as the
73rd Constitutional Amendment Act, 1992 and came into force on 24 April,
19932
 .
73RD AMENDMENT ACT OF 1992
Significance of the Act
This act has added a new Part-IX to the Constitution of India. This part is
entitled as ‘The Panchayats’ and consists of provisions from Articles 243 to
243 O. In addition, the act has also added a new Eleventh Schedule to the
Constitution. This schedule contains 29 functional items of the panchayats.
It deals with Article 243-G.
The act has given a practical shape to Article 40 of the Constitution
which says that, “The State shall take steps to organise village panchayats
and endow them with such powers and authority as may be necessary to
enable them to function as units of self-government.” This article forms a
part of the Directive Principles of State Policy.
The act gives a constitutional status to the panchayati raj institutions. It
has brought them under the purview of the justiciable part of the
Constitution. In other words, the state governments are under constitutional
obligation to adopt the new panchayati raj system in accordance with the
provisions of the act. Consequently, neither the formation of panchayats nor
the holding of elections at regular intervals depend on the will of the state
government any more.
The provisions of the act can be grouped into two categories–compulsory
and voluntary. The compulsory (mandatory or obligatory) provisions of the
act have to be included in the state laws creating the new panchayati raj
system. The voluntary provisions, on the other hand, may be included at the
discretion of the states. Thus the voluntary provisions of the act ensures the
right of the states to take local factors like geographical, politicoadministrative and others, into consideration while adopting the new
panchayati raj system.
The act is a significant landmark in the evolution of grassroot democratic
institutions in the country. It transfers the representative democracy into
participatory democracy. It is a revolutionary concept to build democracy at
the grassroot level in the country.
Salient Features
The salient features of the act are:
Gram Sabha
The act provides for a Gram Sabha as the foundation of the panchayati raj
system. It is a body consisting of persons registered in the electoral rolls of
a village comprised within the area of Panchayat at the village level. Thus,
it is a village assembly consisting of all the registered voters in the area of a
panchayat. It may exercise such powers and perform such functions at the
village level as the legislature of a state determines.
Three-Tier System
The act provides for a three-tier system of panchayati raj in every state, that
is, panchayats at the village, intermediate, and district levels3
. Thus, the act
brings about uniformity in the structure of pan-chayati raj throughout the
country. However, a state having a population not exceeding 20 lakh may
not constitute panchayats at the intermediate level.
Election of Members and Chairpersons
All the members of panchayats at the village, intermediate and district
levels shall be elected directly by the people. Further, the chairperson of
panchayats at the intermediate and district levels shall be elected indirectly–by and from amongst the elected members thereof. However, the
chairperson of a panchayat at the village level shall be elected in such
manner as the state legislature determines.
The chairperson of a panchayat and other members of a panchayat
elected directly or indirectly shall have the right to vote in the meetings of
the panchayats.
Reservation of Seats
The act provides for the reservation of seats for scheduled castes and
scheduled tribes in every panchayat (i.e., at all the three levels) in
proportion of their population to the total population in the panchayat area.
Further, the state legislature shall provide for the reservation of offices of
chairperson in the panchayat at the village or any other level for the SCs
and STs.
The act provides for the reservation of not less than one-third of the total
number of seats for women (including the number of seats reserved for
women belonging the SCs and STs). Further, not less than one-third of the
total number of offices of chairpersons in the panchayats at each level shall
be reserved for women.
The act also authorises the legislature of a state to make any provision for
reservation of seats in any panchayat or offices of chairperson in the
panchayat at any level in favour of backward classes.
The reservation of seats as well as the reservation of offices of
chairpersons in the panchayats for the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes
shall cease to have effect after the expiration of the period specified in
Article 334 (which is presently seventy years, that is, till 2020).
It must be noted here that the above provision relating to the reservation
of seats in panchayats (both members and chairpersons) for the scheduled
castes is not applicable to the state of Arunachal Pradesh. This is because
the state is inhabited fully by indigenous tribal people and there are no
scheduled castes. This provision was added later by the 83rd Constitutional
Amendment Act of 2000.
Duration of Panchayats
The act provides for a five-year term of office to the panchayat at every
level. However, it can be dissolved before the completion of its term.
Further, fresh elections to constitute a panchayat shall be completed (a)
before the expiry of its duration of five years; or (b) in case of dissolution,
before the expiry of a period of six months from the date of its dissolution.
But, where the remainder of the period (for which the dissolved
panchayat would have continued) is less than six months, it shall not be
necessary to hold any election for constituting the new panchayat for such
period.
Moreover, a panchayat constituted upon the dissolution of a panchayat
before the expiration of its duration shall continue only for the remainder of
the period for which the dissolved panchayat would have continued had it
not been so dissolved. In other words, a panchayat reconstituted after
premature dissolution does not enjoy the full period of five years but
remains in office only for the remainder of the period.
Disqualifications
A person shall be disqualified for being chosen as or for being a member of
panchayat if he is so disqualified, (a) under any law for the time being in
force for the purpose of elections to the legislature of the state concerned, or
(b) under any law made by the state legislature. However, no person shall
be disqualified on the ground that he is less than 25 years of age if he has
attained the age of 21 years. Further, all questions of disqualifications shall
be referred to such authority as the state legislature determines.
State Election Commission
The superintendence, direction and control of the preparation of electoral
rolls and the conduct of all elections to the panchayats shall be vested in the
state election commission. It consists of a state election commissioner to be
appointed by the governor. His conditions of service and tenure of office
shall also be determined by the governor. He shall not be removed from the
office except in the manner and on the grounds prescribed for the removal
of a judge of the state high court4
. His conditions of service shall not be
varied to his disadvantage after his appointment.
The state legislature may make provision with respect to all matters
relating to elections to the panchayats.
Powers and Functions
The state legislature may endow the Panchayats with such powers and
authority as may be necessary to enable them to function as institutions of
self-government. Such a scheme may contain provisions for the devolution
of powers and responsibilities upon Panchayats at the appropriate level with
respect to (a) the preparation of plans for economic development and social
justice; (b) the implementation of schemes for economic development and
social justice as may be entrusted to them, including those in relation to the
29 matters listed in the Eleventh Schedule.
Finances
The state legislature may (a) authorise a panchayat to levy, collect and
appropriate taxes, duties, tolls and fees; (b) assign to a panchayat taxes,
duties, tolls and fees levied and collected by the state government; (c)
provide for making grants-in-aid to the panchayats from the consolidated
fund of the state; and (d) provide for constitution of funds for crediting all
moneys of the panchayats.
Finance Commission
The governor of a state shall, after every five years, constitute a finance
commission to review the financial position of the panchayats. It shall make
the following recommendations to the Governor:
1.  The principles that should govern:
(a)  The distribution between the state and the panchayats of the net
proceeds of the taxes, duties, tolls and fees levied by the state and
allocation of shares amongst the panchay-ats at all levels.
(b)  The determination of taxes, duties, tolls and fees that may be
assigned to the panchayats.
(c)  The grants-in-aid to the panchayats from the consolidated fund of
the state.
2.  The measures needed to improve the financial position of the
panchayats.
3.  Any other matter referred to it by the governor in the interests of
sound finance of the panchayats.
The state legislature may provide for the composition of the commission,
the required qualifications of its members and the manner of their selection.
The governor shall place the recommendations of the commission along
with the action taken report before the state legislature.
The Central Finance Commission shall also suggest the measures needed
to augment the consolidated fund of a state to supplement the resources of
the panchayats in the states (on the basis of the recommendations made by
the finance commission of the state).
Audit of Accounts
The state legislature may make provisions with respect to the maintenance
of accounts by the panchayats and the auditing of such accounts.
Application to Union Territories
The provisions of this Part are applicable to the Union territories. But, the
President may direct that they would apply to a Union territory subject to
such exceptions and modifications as he may specify.
Exempted States and Areas
The act does not apply to the states of Nagaland, Meghalaya and Mizoram
and certain other areas. These areas include, (a) the scheduled areas and the
tribal areas in the states5
; (b) the hill areas of Manipur for which district
councils exist; and (c) Darjeeling district of West Bengal for which
Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council exists.
However, the Parliament may extend the provisions of this Part to the
scheduled areas and tribal areas subject to such exceptions and
modifications as it may specify. Under this provision, the Parliament has
enacted the “Provisions of the Panchayats (Extension to the Scheduled
Areas Act”, 1996, popularly known as the PESA Act or the Extension Act.
Continuance of Existing Laws and Panchayats
All the state laws relating to panchayats shall continue to be in force until
the expiry of one year from the commencement of this act. In other words,
the states have to adopt the new panchayati raj system based on this act
within the maximum period of one year from 24 April, 1993, which was the
date of the commencement of this act. However, all the panchayats existing
immediately before the commencement of act shall continue till the expiry
of their term, unless dissolved by the state legislature sooner.
Consequently, majority of states passed the panchayati raj acts in 1993
and 1994 to adopt the new system in accordance with the 73rd
Constitutional Amendment Act of 1992.
Bar to Interference by Courts in Electoral Matters
The act bars the interference by courts in the electoral matters of
panchayats. It declares that the validity of any law relating to the
delimitation of constituencies or the allotment of seats to such
constituencies cannot be questioned in any court. It further lays down that
no election to any panchayat is to be questioned except by an election
petition presented to such authority and in such manner as provided by the
state legislature.
Eleventh Schedule
It contains the following 29 functional items placed within the purview of
panchayats:
1.  Agriculture, including agricultural extension
2.  Land improvement, implementation of land reforms, land
consolidation and soil conservation
3.  Minor irrigation, water management and watershed development

The provisions of Part IX of the constitution relating to the Panchayats are
not applicable to the Fifth Schedule areas. However, the Parliament may
extend these provisions to such areas, subject to such exceptions and
modifications as it may specify. Under this provision, the Parliament has
enacted the “Provisions of the Panchayats (Extension to the Scheduled
Areas) Act”, 1996, popularly known as the PESA Act or the Extension Act.
At present (2019), ten states have Fifth Schedule Areas. These are:
Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Chhatisgarh, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh,
Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha and Rajasthan. All the
ten states have enacted requisite compliance legislations by amending the
respective Panchayati Raj Acts.
Objectives of the Act
The objectives of the PESA Act are as follows6
 :
1.  To extend the provisions of Part IX of the Constitution relating to
the panchayats to the scheduled areas with certain modifications

their term, unless dissolved by the State Legislature sooner.
FINANCES OF PANCHAYATI RAJ
The Second Administrative Reforms Commission of India (2005–2009) has
summarized the sources of revenue of the Panchayati Raj Institutions
(PRIs) and their financial problems in the following way7a
:
1.  A major portion of Part IX of the Constitution deals with structural
empowerment of the PRIs but the real strength in terms of both
autonomy and efficiency of these institutions is dependent on their
financial position (including their capacity to generate own resources).
In general, Panchayats in our country receive funds in the following
ways:
(i) Grants from the Union Government based on the
recommendations of the Central Finance Commission as per
Article 280 of the Constitution.
(ii) Devolution from the State Government based on the
recommendations of the State Finance Commission as per
Article 243-I.
(iii) Loans / grants from the State Government.
(iv) Programme-specific allocation under Centrally Sponsored
Schemes and Additional Central Assistance.
(v) Internal Resource Generation (tax and non-tax).
2.  Across the country, States have not given adequate attention to
fiscal empowerment of the Panchayats. The Panchayats own resources
are meager. Kerala, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu are the states which are
considered to be progressive in PRIs empowerment but even there, the
Panchayats are heavily dependent on government grants. One can
draw the following broad conclusions:
(i) Internal resource generation at the Panchayat level is weak.
This is partly due to a thin tax domain and partly due to
Panchayats own reluctance in collecting revenue.
(ii) Panchayats are heavily dependent on grants from Union and
State Governments.
(iii) A major portion of the grants both from Union as well as the
State Governments is scheme specific. Panchayats have
limited discretion and flexibility in incurring expenditure.
(iv) In view of their own tight fiscal position, State Governments
are not keen to devolve funds to Panchayats.
(v) In most of the critical Eleventh Schedule matters like
primary education, healthcare, water supply, sanitation and
minor irrigation even now, it is the State Government which
is directly responsible for implementation of these
programmes and hence expenditure.
(vi) Overall, a situation has been created where Panchayats have
responsibility but grossly inadequate resources.
3.  Though, in absolute terms, the quantum of funds the Union/State
Government transfers to a Panchayat forms the major component of its
receipt, the PRI’s own resource generation is the soul behind its
financial standing. It is not only a question of resources; it is the
existence of a local taxation system which ensures people’s
involvement in the affairs of an elected body. It also makes the
institution accountable to its citizens.
4.  In terms of own resource collection, the Gram Panchayats are
comparatively in a better position because they have a tax domain of
their own, while the other two tiers are dependent only on tolls, fees
and non-tax revenue for generating internal resources.
5.  State Panchayati Raj Acts have given most of the taxation powers
to Village Panchayats. The revenue domain of the intermediate and
District Panchayats (both tax as well as non-tax) has been kept much
smaller and remains confined to secondary areas like ferry services,
markets, water and conservancy services, registration of vehicles, cess
on stamp duty and a few others.
6.  A study of various State Legislations indicates that a number of
taxes, duties, tolls and fees come under the jurisdiction of the Village
Panchayats. These interalia include octroi, prop-erty/house tax,
profession tax, land tax/cess, taxes/tolls on vehicles, entertainment
tax/fees, license fees, tax on non-agriculture land, fee on registration of
cattle, sanitation/drainage/ conservancy tax, water rate/ tax, lighting
rate/tax, education cess and tax on fairs and festivals.
REASONS FOR INEFFECTIVE PERFORMANCE
Even after conferring the constitutional status and protection through the
73rd Amendment Act (1992), the performance of the Panchayati Raj
Institutions (PRIs) has not been satisfactory and not upto the expected level.
The various reasons for this sub-optimal performance are as follows7b
:
1.  Lack of adequate devolution: Many States have not taken
adequate steps to devolve 3Fs (i.e., functions, funds and functionaries)
to the PRIs to enable them to discharge their constitutionally stipulated
function. Further, it is imperative that the PRIs have resources to
match the responsibilities entrusted to them. While SFCs (state finance
commissions) have submitted their recommendations, not many few
States have implemented these or taken steps to ensure the fiscal
viability of the PRIs.
2.  Excessive control by bureaucracy: In some States, the Gram
Panchayats have been placed in a position of subordination. Hence, the
Gram Panchayat Sarpanches have to spend extraordinary amount of
time visiting Block Offices for funds and/or technical approval. These
interactions with the Block staff office distort the role of Sarpanches as
elected representatives.
3.  Tied nature of funds: This has two implications. The activities
stated under a certain scheme are not always appropriate for all parts
of the district. This results in unsuitable activities being promoted or
an under-spend of the funds.
4.  Overwhelming dependency on government funding: A review of
money received and own source funds shows the overwhelming
dependence of Panchayats on government funding. When Panchayats
do not raise resources and instead receive funds from outside, people
are less likely to request a social audit.
5.  Reluctance to use fiscal powers: An important power devolved to
GP (Gram Panchayat) is the right to levy tax on property, business,
markets, fairs and also for services provided, like street lighting or
public toilets, etc. Very few Panchayats use their fiscal power to levy
and collect taxes. The argument pushed by Panchayat heads is that it is
difficult to levy tax on your own constituency, especially when you
live in the community.
6.  Status of the Gram Sabha: Empowering the Gram Sabhas could
have been a powerful weapon for transparency, accountability and for
involvement of the marginalized sections. However, a number of the
State Acts have not spelt the powers of Gram Sabhas nor have any
procedures been laid down for the functioning of these bodies or
penalties for the officials.
7.  Creation of Parallel Bodies: Often, Parallel Bodies (PBs) are
created for supposedly speedy implementation and greater
accountability. However, there is little evidence to show that such PBs
have avoided the evils including that of partisan politics, sharing of
spoils, corruption and elite capture. Missions (in particular) often
bypassing mainstream programmes, create disconnect, duality, and
alienation between the existing and the new structures and functions.
PBs usurp the legitimate space of PRIs and demoralize the PRIs by
virtue of their superior resource endowments.
8.  Poor Infrastructure: A large number of Gram Panchayats in the
country do not have even full time Secretary. Around 25 percent of the
Gram Panchayats do not have basic office buildings. The database for
planning, monitoring etc., are lacking in most of the cases.
A large number of elected representatives of PRIs are semi-literate
or literate and know little about their roles & responsibilities,
programmes, procedures, systems. Often for want of good, relevant
and periodic training, they are not able to perform their functions
properly.
Although all the District and Intermediate Panchayats are connected
with computers, only around 20% Gram Panchayats reported to be
having computing facility. In some States, Village Panchayats do not
have any computing facility.

39 Municipalities
The term ‘Urban Local Government’ in India signifies the governance of
an urban area by the people through their elected representatives. The
jurisdiction of an urban local government is limited to a specific urban area
which is demarcated for this purpose by the state government1
 .
There are eight types of urban local governments in India–municipal
corporation, municipality, notified area committee, town area committee,
cantonment board, township, port trust and special purpose agency.
The system of urban government was constitutionalised through the 74th
Constitutional Amendment Act of 1992. At the Central level, the subject of
‘urban local government’ is dealt with by the following three ministries:
(i) Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs.
(ii) Ministry of Defence in the case of cantonment boards
(iii) Ministry of Home Affairs in the case of Union Territories
EVOLUTION OF URBAN BODIES
Historical Perspective
The institutions of urban local government originated and developed in
modern India during the period of British rule. The major events in this
context are as follows:
(i) In 1688, the first municipal corporation in India was set up at
Madras.
(ii) In 1726, the municipal corporations were set up in Bombay and
Calcutta.
(iii) Lord Mayo’s Resolution of 1870 on financial decentralisation
visualised the development of local self-government institutions.
(iv) Lord Ripon’s Resolution of 1882 has been hailed as the ‘Magna
Carta’ of local self-government. He is called as the father of
local-self government in India.
(v) The Royal Commission on decentralisation was appointed in
1907 and it submitted its report in 1909. Its chairman was
Hobhouse.
(vi) Under the dyarchical scheme introduced in Provinces by the
Government of India Act of 1919, local self-government became
a transferred subject under the charge of a responsible Indian
minister.
(vii) In 1924, the Cantonments Act was passed by the Central
legislature.
(viii) Under the provincial autonomy scheme introduced by the
Government of India Act of 1935, local self-government was
declared a provincial subject.
Committees and Commissions
The committees and commissions appointed by the Central Government to
improve the functioning of urban local governments are mentioned below
in Table 39.1.
Constitutionalisation
In August 1989, the Rajiv Gandhi government introduced the 65th
Constitutional Amendment Bill (i.e., Nagarpalika Bill) in the Lok Sabha.
The bill aimed at strengthening and revamping the municipal bodies by
conferring a constitutional status on them. Although the bill was passed in
the Lok Sabha, it was defeated in the Rajya Sabha in October 1989 and
hence, lapsed.

The National Front Government under V P Singh introduced the revised
Nagarpalika Bill in the Lok Sabha again in September 1990. However, the
bill was not passed and finally lapsed due to the dissolution of the Lok
Sabha.
P V Narasimha Rao’s Government also introduced the modified
Municipalities Bill inthe Lok Sabha in September 1991. It finally emerged
as the 74th Constitutional Amendment Act of 1992 and came into force on
1 June 19932
 .
74TH AMENDMENT ACT OF 1992
This Act has added a new Part IX-A to the Constitution of India. This part
is entitled as ‘The Municipalities’ and consists of provisions from Articles
243-P to 243-ZG. In addition, the act has also added a new Twelfth
Schedule to the Constitution. This schedule contains eighteen functional
items of municipalities. It deals with Article 243-W.
The act gave constitutional status to the municipalities. It has brought
them under the purview of justiciable part of the Constitution. In other
words, state governments are under constitutional obligation to adopt the
new system of municipalities in accordance with the provisions of the act.
The act aims at revitalising and strengthening the urban governments so
that they function effectively as units of local government.
Salient Features
The salient features of the act are:
Three Types of Municipalities
The act provides for the constitution of the following three types of
municipalities in every state.
1.  A nagar panchayat (by whatever name called) for a transitional
area3
 .
2.  A municipal council for a smaller urban area.
3.  A municipal corporation for a larger urban area.
But, there is one exception. If there is an urban area where municipal
services are being provided by an industrial establishment, then the
governor may specify that area to be an industrial township. In such a case,
a municipality may not be constituted.
The governor has to specify a transitional area, a smaller urban area or a
larger urban area, keeping in view the following factors:
(a)  Population of the area.
(b)  Density of the population therein.
(c)  Revenue generated for local administration.
(d)  Percentage of employment in non-agricultural activities.
(e)  Economic importance.
(f)  Such other factors as he may deem fit.
Composition
All the members of a municipality shall be elected directly by the people of
the municipal area. For this purpose, each municipal area shall be divided
into territorial constituencies to be known as wards. The state legislature
may provide the manner of election of the chairperson of a municipality. It
may also provide for the representation of the following persons in a
municipality.
1.  Persons having special knowledge or experience in municipal
administration without the right to vote in the meetings of
municipality.
2.  The members of the Lok Sabha and the state legislative assembly
representing constituencies that comprise wholly or partly the
municipal area.
3.  The members of the Rajya Sabha and the state legislative council
registered as electors within the municipal area.
4.  The chairpersons of committees (other than wards committees).
Wards Committees
There shall be constituted a wards committee, consisting of one or more
wards, within the territorial area of a municipality having population of
three lakh or more. The state legislature may make provision with respect to
the composition and the territorial area of a wards committee and the
manner in which the seats in a wards committee shall be filled.
Other Committees
In addition to the wards committees, the state legislature is also allowed to
make any provision for the constitution of other committees. The
chairpersons of such committees may be made members of the
municipality.
Reservation of Seats
The act provides for the reservation of seats for the scheduled castes and the
scheduled tribes in every municipality in proportion of their population to
the total population in the municipal area. Further, it provides for the
reservation of not less than one-third of the total number of seats for women
(including the number of seats reserved for woman belonging to the SCs
and the STs).
The state legislature may provide for the manner of reservation of offices
of chairpersons in the municipalities for SCs, STs and women. It may also
make any provision for the reservation of seats in any municipality or
offices of chairpersons in municipalities in favour of backward classes.
The reservation of seats as well as the reservation of offices of
chairpersons in the municipalities for the scheduled castes and scheduled
tribes shall cease to have effect after the expiration of the period specified
in Article 334 (which is presently seventy years, that is, till 2020).
Duration of Municipalities
The act provides for a five-year term of office for every municipality.
However, it can be dissolved before the completion of its term. Further, the
fresh elections to constitute a municipality shall be completed (a) before the
expiry of its duration of five years; or (b) in case of dissolution, before the
expiry of a period of six months from the date of its dissolution.
But, where the remainder of the period (for which the dissolved
municipality would have continued) is less than six months, it shall not be
necessary to hold any election for constituting the new municipality for
such period.
Moreover, a municipality constituted upon the dissolution of a
municipality before the expiration of its duration shall continue only for the
remainder of the period for which the dissolved municipality would have
continued had it not been so dissolved. In other words, a municipality
reconstituted after premature dissolution does not enjoy the full period of
five years but remains in office only for the remainder of the period.
The act also makes two more provisions with respect to dissolution: (a) a
municipality must be given a reasonable opportunity of being heard before
its dissolution; and (b) no amendment of any law for the time being in force
shall cause dissolution of a municipality before the expiry of the five years
term.
Disqualifications
A person shall be disqualified for being chosen as or for being a member of
a municipality if he is so disqualified (a) under any law for the time being in
force for the purposes of elections to the legislature of the state concerned;
or (b) under any law made by the state legislature. However, no person shall
be disqualified on the ground that he is less than 25 years of age if he has
attained the age of 21 years. Further, all questions of disqualifications shall
be referred to such authority as the state legislature determines.
State Election Commission
The superintendence, direction and control of the preparation of electoral
rolls and the conduct of all elections to the municipalities shall be vested in
the state election commission.
The state legislature may make provision with respect to all matters
relating to elections to the municipalities.
Powers and Functions
The state legislature may endow the municipalities with such powers and
authority as may be necessary to enable them to function as institutions of
self-government. Such a scheme may contain provisions for the devolution
of powers and responsibilities upon municipalities at the appropriate level
with respect to (a) the preparation of plans for economic development and
social justice; (b) the implementation of schemes for economic
development and social justice as may be entrusted to them, including those
in relation to the eighteen matters listed in the Twelfth Schedule.
Finances
The state legislature may (a) authorise a municipality to levy, collect and
appropriate taxes, duties, tolls and fees; (b) assign to a municipality taxes,
duties, tolls and fees levied and collected by state government; (c) provide
for making grants-in-aid to the municipalities from the consolidated fund of
the state; and (d) provide for constitution of funds for crediting all moneys
of the municipalities.
Finance Commission
The finance commission (which is constituted for the panchayats) shall
also, for every five years, review the financial position of municipalities and
make recommendation to the governor as to:
1.  The principles that should govern:
(a)  The distribution between the state and the municipalities of the net
proceeds of the taxes, duties, tolls and fees levied by the state and
allocation of shares amongst the municipalities at all levels.
(b)  The determination of the taxes, duties, tolls and fees that may be
assigned to the municipalities.
(c)  The grants-in-aid to the municipalities from the consolidated fund
of the state.
2.  The measures needed to improve the financial position of the
municipalities.
3.  Any other matter referred to it by the governor in the interests of
sound finance of municipalities.
The governor shall place the recommendations of the commission along
with the action taken report before the state legislature.
The central finance commission shall also suggest the measures needed
to augment the consolidated fund of a state to supplement the resources of
the municipalities in the state (on the basis of the recommendations made
by the finance commission of the state).
Audit of Accounts
The state legislature may make provisions with respect to the maintenance
of accounts by municipalities and the auditing of such accounts.
Application to Union Territories
The provisions of this part are applicable to the Union territories. But, the
President may direct that they would apply to a Union territory subject to
such exceptions and modifications as he may specify.
Exempted Areas
The act does not apply to the scheduled areas and tribal areas in the states4
.
It shall also not affect the functions and powers of the Darjeeling Gorkha
Hill Council of the West Bengal.
However, the Parliament may extend the provisions of this part to the
scheduled areas and tribal areas subject to such exceptions and
modifications as it may specify.
District Planning Committee
Every state shall constitute at the district level, a district planning
committee to consolidate the plans prepared by panchayats and
municipalities in the district, and to prepare a draft development plan for the
district as a whole. The state legislature may make provisions with respect

2.  The manner of election of members of such committees;
3.  The functions of such committees in relation to district planning;
and
4.  The manner of the election of the chairpersons of such committees.
The act lays down that four-fifths of the members of a district planning
committee should be elected by the elected members of the district
panchayat and municipalities in the district from amongst themselves. The
representation of these members in the committee should be in proportion
to the ratio between the rural and urban populations in the district.
The chairperson of such committee shall forward the development plan
to the state government.
In preparing the draft development plan, a district planning committee
shall
(a)  Have regard to–
(i) matters of common interest between the Panchayats and the
Municipalities including spatial planning, sharing of water
and other physical and natural resources, the integrated
development of infrastructure and environmental
conservation;
(ii) the extent and type of available resources whether financial
or otherwise; and
(b)  Consult such institutions and organisations as the Governor may
specify.
Metropolitan Planning Committee
Every metropolitan area shall have a metropolitan planning committee to
prepare a draft development plan5
. The state legislature may make
provisions with respect to the following:
1.  The composition of such committees;
2.  The manner of election of members of such committees;
3.  The representation in such committes of the Central government,
state government and other organisations;
4.  The functions of such committees in relation to planning and
coordination for the metropolitan area; and
5.  The manner of election of chairpersons of such committees.
The act lays down that two-thirds of the members of a metropolitan
planning committee should be elected by the elected members of the
municipalities and chairpersons of the panchayats in the metropolitan area
from amongst themselves. The representation of these members in the
committee should be in proportion to the ratio between the population of
the municipalities and the panchayats in that metropolitan area.
The chairpersons of such committees shall forward the development plan
to the state government.
In preparing the draft development plan, a metropolitan planning
committee shall
(a)  Have regard to–
(i) the plans prepared by the Municipalities and the Panchayats
in the Metropolitan area;
(ii) matters of common interest between the Municipalities and
the Pan-chayats, including co-ordinated spatial planning of
the area, sharing of water and other physical and natural
resources, the integrated development of infrastructure and
environmental conservation;
(iii) the overall objectives and priorities set by the Government
of India and the government of the state;
(iv) the extent and nature of investments likely to be made in the
Metropolitan area by agencies of the Government of India
and of the Government of the State and other available
resources whether financial or otherwise; and
(b)  consult such institutions and organisations as the Governor may
specify.
Continuance of Existing Laws and Municipalities
All the state laws relating to municipalities shall continue to be in force
until the expiry of one year from the commencement of this act. In other
words, the states have to adopt the new system of municipalities based on
this act within the maximum period of one year from 1 June, 1993, which is
the date of commencement of this act. However, all municipalities existing
immediately before the commencement of this act shall continue till the
expiry of their term, unless dissolved by the state legislature sooner.
Bar to Interference by Courts in Electoral Matters
The act bars the interference by courts in the electoral matters of
municipalities. It declares that the validity of any law relating to the
delimitation of constituencies or the allotment of seats to such
constituencies cannot be questioned in any court. It further lays down that
no election to any municipality is to be questioned except by an election
petition presented to such authority and in such manner as provided by the
state legislature.

TYPES OF URBAN GOVERNMENTS
The following eight types of urban local bodies are created in India for the
administration of urban areas:
•  Municipal Corporation
•  Municipality
•  Notified Area Committee
•  Town Area Committee
•  Cantonment Board
•  Township
•  Port Trust
•  Special Purpose Agency
1. Municipal Corporation
Municipal corporations are created for the administration of big cities like
Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Hyderabad, Bangalore and others. They are
established in the states by the acts of the concerned state legislatures, and
in the union territories by the acts of the Parliament of India. There may be
one common act for all the municipal corporations in a state or a separate
act for each municipal corporation.
A municipal corporation has three authorities, namely, the council, the
standing committees and the commissioner.
The Council is the deliberative and legislative wing of the corporation. It
consists of the Councillors directly elected by the people, as well as a few
nominated persons having knowledge or experience of municipal
administration. In brief, the composition of the Council including the
reservation of seats for SCs, STs and women is governed by the 74th
Constitutional Amendment Act.
The Council is headed by a Mayor. He is assisted by a Deputy Mayor. He
is elected in a majority of the states for a one-year renewable term. He is
basically an ornamental figure and a formal head of the corporation. His
main function is to preside over the meetings of the Council.
The standing committees are created to facilitate the working of the
council, which is too large in size. They deal with public works, education,
health, taxation, finance and so on. They take decisions in their fields.
The municipal commissioner is responsible for the implementation of the
decisions taken by the council and its standing committees. Thus, he is the
chief executive authority of the corporation. He is appointed by the state
government and is generally a member of the IAS.
2. Municipality
The municipalities are established for the administration of towns and
smaller cities. Like the corporations, they are also set up in the states by the
acts of the concerned state legislatures and in the union territory by the acts
of the Parliament of India. They are also known by various other names like
municipal council, municipal committee, municipal board, borough
municipality, city municipality and others.
Like a municipal corporation, a municipality also has three authorities,
namely, the council, the standing committees and the chief executive
officer.
The council is the deliberative and legislative wing of the municipality. It
consists of the councillors directly elected by the people.
The council is headed by a president/chair-man. He is assisted by a vicepresident/vice-chairman. He presides over the meetings of the council.
Unlike the Mayor of a municipal corporation, he plays a significant role and
is the pivot of the municipal administration. Apart from presiding over the
meetings of the Council, he enjoys executive powers.
The standing committees are created to facilitate the working of the
council. They deal with public works, taxation, health, finance and so on.
The chief executive officer/chief municipal officer is responsible for dayto-day general administration of the municipality. He is appointed by the
state government.
3. Notified Area Committee
A notified area committee is created for the administration of two types of
areas–a fast developing town due to industrialisation, and a town which
does not yet fulfil all the conditions necessary for the constitution of a
municipality, but which otherwise is considered important by the state
government. Since it is established by a notification in the government
gazette, it is called as notified area committee. Though it functions within
the framework of the State Municipal Act, only those provisions of the act
apply to it which are notified in the government gazette by which it is
created. It may also be entrusted to exercise powers under any other act. Its
powers are almost equivalent to those of a municipality. But unlike the
municipality, it is an entirely nominated body, that is, all the members of a
notified area committee including the chairman are nominated by the state
government. Thus, it is neither an elected body nor a statutory body.
4. Town Area Committee
A town area committee is set up for the administration of a small town. It is
a semimunicipal authority and is entrusted with a limited number of civic
functions like drainage, roads, street lighting, and conservancy. It is created
by a separate act of a state legislature. Its composition, functions and other
matters are governed by the act. It may be wholly elected or wholly
nominated by the state government or partly elected and partly nominated6
 .
5. Cantonment Board
A cantonment board is established for municipal administration for civilian
population in the cantonment area7
. It is set up under the provisions of the
Cantonments Act of 2006–a legislation enacted by the Central government.
It works under the administrative control of the defence ministry of the
Central government. Thus, unlike the above four types of urban local
bodies, which are created and administered by the state government, a
cantonment board is created as well as administered by the Central
government.
The Cantonments Act of 2006 was enacted to consolidate and amend the
law relating to the administration of cantonments with a view to impart
greater democratisation, improvement of their financial base to make
provisions for developmental activities and for matters connected with
them. This Act has repealed the Cantonments Act of 1924.
At present (2019), there are 62 cantonment boards in the country. They
are grouped into four categories on the basis of the civil population. This is
shown below in Table 39.2.
Table 39.2  Classification of Cantonment Boards
Category Civil Population
I  above 50,000 
II  10,000 to 50,000 
III  2,500 to 10,000 
IV  Below 2,500 
A cantonment board consists of partly elected and partly nominated
members. The elected members hold office for a term of five years while
the nominated members (i.e., ex-officio members) continue so long as they
hold the office in that station. The military officer commanding the station
is the ex-officio president of the board and presides over its meetings. The
vice-president of the board is elected by the elected members from amongst
themselves for a term of five years.
The Category I cantonment board consists of the following members:
(i) A military officer commanding the station
(ii) An executive engineer in the cantonment
(iii) A health officer in the cantonment
(iv) A first class magistrate nominated by the district magistrate
(v) Three military officers nominated by the officer commanding the
station
(vi) Eight members elected by the people of the cantonment area
(vii) Chief Executive Officer of the cantonment board
The functions performed by a cantonment board are similar to those of a
municipality. These are statutorily categorised into obligatory functions and
discretionary functions. The sources of income includes both, tax revenue
and non-tax revenue.
The executive officer of the cantonment board is appointed by the
president of India. He implements all the resolutions and decisions of the
board and its committees. He belongs to the central cadre established for the
purpose.
6. Township
This type of urban government is established by the large public enterprises
to provide civic amenities to its staff and workers who live in the housing
colonies built near the plant. The enterprise appoints a town administrator
to look after the administration of the township. He is assisted by some
engineers and other technical and non-technical staff. Thus, the township
form of urban government has no elected members. In fact, it is an
extension of the bureaucratic structure of the enterprises.
7. Port Trust
The port trusts are established in the port areas like Mumbai, Kolkata,
Chennai and so on for two purposes: (a) to manage and protect the ports;
and (b) to provide civic amenities. Aport trust is created by an Act of
Parliament. It consists of both elected and nominated members. Its
chairman is an official. Its civic functions are more or less similar to those
of a municipality.
8. Special Purpose Agency
In addition to these seven area-based urban bodies (or multipurpose
agencies), the states have set up certain agencies to undertake designated
activities or specific functions that ‘legitimately’ belong to the domain of
municipal corporations or municipalities or other local urban governments.
In other words, these are function-based and not areabased. They are known
as ‘single purpose’, ‘uni-purpose’ or ‘special purpose’ agencies or
‘functional local bodies’. Some such bodies are:
1.  Town improvement trusts.
2.  Urban development authorities.
3.  Water supply and sewerage boards.
4.  Housing boards.
5.  Pollution control boards.
6.  Electricity supply boards.
7.  City transport boards.
These functional local bodies are established as statutory bodies by an act
of state legislature or as departments by an executive resolution. They
function as autonomous bodies and deal with the functions allotted to them
independently of the local urban governments, that is, municipal
corporations or municipalities and so forth. Thus, they are not subordinate
agencies of the local municipal bodies.
MUNICIPAL PERSONNEL
There are three types of municipal personnel systems in India. The
personnel working in the urban governments may belong to any one or all
the three types. These are
1. Separate Personnel System: Under this system, each local body
appoints, administers, and controls its own personnel. They are not
transferable to other local bodies. It is the most widely prevalent system.
This system upholds the principle of local autonomy and promotes
undivided loyalty.
2. Unified Personnel System: In this system, the state government appoints,
administers, and controls the municipal personnel. In other words, statewide services (cadres) are created for all the urban bodies in the state. They
are transferable between the local bodies in the state. This system is
prevalent in Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan,
Madhya Pradesh and so on.
3. Integrated Personnel System: Under this system, the personnel of the
state government and those of the local bodies form part of the same
service. In other words, the municipal personnel are the members of the
state services. They are transferable not only between the local bodies in the
state but also between local bodies and departments of state government.
Thus, there is no distinction between local civil service and state civil
service. This system is prevalent in Odisha, Bihar, Karnataka, Punjab,
Haryana and others.
The various national level institutions providing training to the municipal
personnel are
1.  All-India Institute of Local SelfGovernment (Mumbai) constituted
in 1927; it is a private registered society
2.  Centre for Urban and Environmental Studies (New Delhi) set up in
1967 on the recommendation of Nur-uddin Ahmed Committee on
Training of Municipal Employees (1963–1965)
3.  Regional Centres for Urban and Environmental Studies (Kolkata,
Lucknow, Hyderabad and Mumbai) set up in 1968 on the
recommendation of Nur-ud-din Ahmed Committee on Training of
Municipal Employees (1963–1965)
4.  National Institute of Urban Affairs, established in 1976
5.  Human Settlement Management Institute, established in 1985
MUNICIPAL REVENUE
There are five sources of income of the urban local bodies. These are as
follows:
1.  Tax Revenue: The revenue from the local taxes include property
tax, entertainment tax, taxes on advertisements, professional tax, water
tax, tax on animals, lighting tax, pilgrim tax, market tax, toll on new
bridges, octroi and so on. In addition, the municipal bodies imposes
various cesses like library cess, education cess, beggary cess and so
on. Octroi (i.e., taxes on the entry of goods into a local area for
consumption, use or sale therein) has been abolished in most of the
states. Property tax is the most important tax revenue.
2.  Non-Tax Revenue: This source include rent on municipal
properties, fees and fines, royalty, profits and dividends, interest, user
charges and miscellaneous receipts. The user charges (i.e., payment for
public utilities) include water charges, sanitation charges, sewerage
charges and so on.
3.  Grants: These include the various grants given to municipal bodies
by the Central and State Governments for several development
programmes, infrastructure schemes, urban reform initiatives and so
on.
4.  Devolution: This consists of the transfer of funds to the urban local
bodies from the state government. This devolution is made on the basis
of the recommendations of the state finance commission.
5.  Loans: The urban local bodies raise loans from the state
government as well as financial institutions to meet their capital
expenditure. They can borrow from the financial institutions or other
bodies only with the approval of the state government.
CENTRAL COUNCIL OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT
The Central Council of Local Government was set up in 1954. It was
constituted under Article 263 of the Constitution of India by an order of the
President of India. Originally, it was known as the Central Council of Local
Self-Government. However, the term ‘selfgovernment’ was found to be
superfluous and hence was replaced by the term ‘government’ in the 1980s.
Till 1958, it dealt with both urban as well as rural local governments, but
after 1958 it has been dealing with matters of urban local government only.
The Council is an advisory body. It consists of the Minister for Urban
Development in the Government of India and the ministers for local self
government in states. The Union minister acts as the Chairman of the
Council.
The Council performs the following functions with regard to local
government:
(i) Considering and recommending the policy matters
(ii) Making proposals for legislation
(iii) Examining the possibility of cooperation between the Centre and
the states
(iv) Drawing up a common programme of action
(v) Recommending Central financial assistance
(vi) Reviewing the work done by the local bodies with the Central
financial assistance

PART-VI
UNION TERRITORIES AND SPECIAL
AREAS
40. Union Territories
41. Scheduled and Tribal
40 Union Territories
Under Article 1 of the Constitution, the territory of India comprises three
categories of territories: (a) territories of the states; (b) union territories; and
(c) territories that may be acquired by the Government of India at any time.
At present, there are twenty-nine states, seven union territories and no
acquired territories.
The states are the members of the federal system in India and share a
distribution of power with the Centre. The union territories, on the other
hand, are those areas which are under the direct control and administration
of the Central government. Hence, they are also known as ‘centrally
administered territories’. ‘In this way, existence of these territories
constitutes a conspicuous departure from federalism in India; the
Government of India is plainly unitary in so far as the relationship between
New Delhi and these Central enclaves is concerned’1
 .
CREATION OF UNION TERRITORIES
During the British Rule, certain areas were constituted as ‘scheduled
districts’ in 1874. Later, they came to be known as ‘chief commissioners
provinces’. After independence, they were placed in the category of Part
‘C’ States and Part ‘D’ Territories2
. In 1956, they were constituted as the
‘union territories’ by the 7th Constitutional Amendment Act (1956) and the
States Reorganisation Act (1956). Gradually, some of these union territories
have been elevated to statehood. Thus, Himachal Pradesh, Manipur,
Tripura, Mizoram, Arunachal Pradesh and Goa, which are states today were
formerly union territories. On the other hand, the territories that were
acquired from the Portuguese (Goa, Daman and Diu, and Dadra and Nagar
Haveli) and the French (Puducherry) were constituted as the union
territories.
At present, there are nine Union Territories. They are (along with the year
of creation): (1) Andaman and Nicobar Islands–1956, (2) Delhi–1956, (3)
Lakshadweep–1956, (4) Dadra and Nagar Haveli–1961, (5) Daman and
Diu–1962, (6) Puducherry–1962, (7) Chandigarh–1966, (8) Jammu and
Kashmir–2019 and (9) Ladakh–2019. Till 1973, Lakshadweep was known
by the name of Laccadive, Minicoy and Amindivi Islands. In 1992, Delhi
was redesignated as the National Capital Territory of Delhi. Till 2006,
Puducherry was known as Pondicherry.
The union territories have been created for a variety of reasons. These are
mentioned below3
 :
1.  Political and administrative consider-ation–Delhi and Chandigarh.
2.  Cultural distinctiveness–Puducherry, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, and
Daman and Diu.
3.  Strategic importance–Andaman and Nicobar Islands and
Lakshadweep.
4.  Special treatment and care of the backward and tribal people–
Mizoram, Manipur, Tripura and Arunachal Pradesh which later
became states.
In 2019, the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir was bifurcated into
two separate union territories, namely, the Union territory of Jammu and
Kashmir, and the Union territory of Ladakh. While introducing the Jammu
and Kashmir Reorganisation Bill, 2019, in the Parliament, the central
government gave the following reasons for the creation of these two new
union territories:
1.  The Ladakh division of the state of Jammu and Kashmir has a large
area but is sparsely populated with a very difficult terrain. There has
been a long pending demand of people of Ladakh, to give it the status
of a Union territory to enable them to realize their aspirations. The
Union territory of Ladakh will be without a legislature.
2.  Further, keeping in view the prevailing internal security situation,
fuelled by cross border terrorism in the existing state of Jammu and
Kashmir, a separate Union territory for Jammu and Kashmir is being
created. The Union territory of Jammu and Kashmir will be with a
legislature.
ADMINISTRATION OF UNION TERRITORIES
Articles 239 to 241 in Part VIII of the Constitution deal with the union
territories. Even though all the union territories belong to one category,
there is no uniformity in their administrative system.
Every union territory is administered by the President acting through an
administrator appointed by him. An administrator of a union territory is an
agent of the President and not head of state like a governor. The President
can specify the designation of an administrator; it may be Lieutenant
Governor or Chief Commissioner or Administrator. At present, it is
Lieutenant Governor in the case of Delhi, Puducherry, Andaman and
Nicobar Islands, Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh and Administrator in the
case of Chandigarh, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Daman and Diu and
Lakshadweep. The President can also appoint the governor of a state as the
administrator of an adjoining union territory. In that capacity, the governor
is to act independently of his council of ministers.
The Union Territories of Puducherry (in 1963), Delhi (in 1992) and
Jammu and Kashmir (in 2019) are provided with a legislative assembly4
 and
a council of ministers headed by a chief minister. The remaining six union
territories do not have such popular political institutions. But, the
establishment of such institutions in the union territories does not diminish
the supreme control of the president and Parliament over them.
The Parliament can make laws on any subject of the three lists (including
the State List) for the union territories. This power of Parliament also
extends to Puducherry, Delhi and Jammu and Kashmir, which have their
own local legislatures. This means that, the legislative power of Parliament
for the union territories on subjects of the State List remain unaffected even
after establishing a local legislature for them. But, the legislative assembly
of Puducherry can also make laws on any subject of the State List and the
Concurrent List. Similarly, the legislative assembly of Delhi can make laws
on any subject of the State List (except public order, police and land) and
the Concurrent List. Likewise, the legislative assembly of Jammu and
Kashmir can make laws on any subject of the State List (except public order
and police) and the Concurrent List.
The President can make regulations for the peace, progress and good
government of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Lakshadweep, Dadra and
Nagar Haveli, Daman and Diu and Ladakh. In the case of Puducherry also,
the President can legislate by making regulations but only when the
assembly is suspended or dissolved. A regulation made by the President has
the same force and effect as an act of Parliament and can also repeal or
amend any act of Parliament in relation to these union territories.
The Parliament can establish a high court for a union territory or put it
under the jurisdiction of the high court of adjacent state. Delhi is the only
union territory that has a high court of its own (since 1966). The Bombay
High Court has got jurisdiction over two union territo-ries–Dadra and
Nagar Haveli, and Daman and Diu. Andaman and Nocobar Islands,
Chandigarh, Lakshadweep and Puducherry are placed under the Calcutta,
Punjab and Haryana, Kerala, and Madras High Courts respectively. The
Jammu and Kashmir High Court is the common high court for the two
union territories of Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh.
The Constitution does not contain any separate provisions for the
administration of acquired territories. But, the constitutional provisions for
the administration of union territories also apply to the acquired territories.
SPECIAL PROVISIONS FOR DELHI
The 69th Constitutional Amendment Act of 19915 provided a special status
to the Union Territory of Delhi, and redesignated it the National Capital
Territory of Delhi and designated the administrator of Delhi as the
lieutenant (lt.) governor. It created a legislative assembly and a council of
ministers for Delhi. Previously, Delhi had a metropolitan council and an
executive council.
The strength of the assembly is fixed at 70 members, directly elected by
the people. The elections are conducted by the election commission of
India. The assembly can make laws on all the matters of the State List and
the Concurrent List except the three matters of the State List, that is, public
order, police and land. But, the laws of Parliament prevail over those made
by the Assembly.
The strength of the council of ministers is fixed at ten per cent of the total
strength of the assembly, that is, seven–one chief minister and six other
ministers. The chief minister is appointed by the President (not by the lt.
governor). The other ministers are appointed by the president on the advice
of the chief minister. The ministers hold office during the pleasure of the
president. The council of ministers is collectively responsible to the
assembly.
The council of ministers headed by the chief minister aid and advise the
lt. governor in the exercise of his functions except in so far as he is required
to act in his discretion. In the case of difference of opinion between the lt.
governor and his ministers, the lt. governor is to refer the matter to the
president for decision and act accordingly.
When a situation arises in which the administration of the territory cannot
be carried on in accordance with the above provisions, the president can
suspend their (above provisions) operation and make the necessary
incidental or consequential provisions for administering the territory. In
brief, in case of failure of constitutional machinery, the president can
impose his rule in the territory. This can be done on the report of the lt.
governor or otherwise. This provision resembles Article 356 which deals
with the imposition of President’s Rule in the states.
The lt. governor is empowered to promulgate ordinances during recess of
the assembly. An ordinance has the same force as an act of the assembly.
Every such ordinance must be approved by the assembly within six weeks
from its reassembly. He can also withdraw an ordinance at any time. But, he
cannot promulgate an ordinance when the assembly is dissolved or
suspended. Further, no such ordinance can be promulgated or withdrawn
without the prior permission of the President.
ADVISORY COMMITTEES OF UNION TERRITORIES
Under the Government of India (Allocation of Business) Rules 1961,
Ministry of Home Affairs is the nodal ministry for all matters of Union
Territories relating to legislation, finance and budget, services and
appointment of Lt. Governors and Administrators.
All the six UTs without legislature (Andaman and Nicobar Islands,
Chandigarh, Daman and Diu, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Lakshadweep and
Ladakh) have the forum of Home Minister’s Advisory Committee
(HMAC)/Administrator’s Advisory Committee (AAC). While HMAC is
chaired by the Union Home Minister, AAC is chaired by the Administrator
of the concerned UTs. The Member of Parliament and elected members
from the local bodies e.g. District Panchayats and Municipal Council of the
respective UTs are members of these committees among others. The
Committee discusses the general issues relating to social and economic
development of the UTs.6

41 Scheduled and Tribal Areas
Article 244 in Part X of the Constitution envisages a special system of
administration for certain areas designated as ‘scheduled areas’ and ‘tribal
areas’. The Fifth Schedule of the Constitution deals with the administration
and control of scheduled areas and scheduled tribes in any state except the
four states of Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura and Mizoram1
. The Sixth
Schedule of the Constitution, on the other hand, deals with the
administration of the tribal areas in the four northeastern states of Assam,
Meghalaya, Tripura and Mizoram.
ADMINISTRATION OF SCHEDULED AREAS
‘The scheduled areas are treated differently from the other areas in the
country because they are inhabited by ‘aboriginals’ who are socially and
economically rather backward, and special efforts need to be made to
improve their condition. Therefore, the whole of the normal administrative
machinery operating in a state is not extended to the scheduled areas and
the Central government has somewhat greater responsibility for these
areas’2
 .
The various features of administration contained in the Fifth Schedule are
as follows:
1.  Declaration of Scheduled Areas: The president is empowered to
declare an area to be a scheduled area. He can also increase or
decrease its area, alter its boundary lines, rescind such designation or
make fresh orders for such redesignation on an area in consultation
with the governor of the state concerned.
2.  Executive Power of State and Centre: The executive power of a
state extends to the scheduled areas therein. But the governor has a
special responsibility regarding such areas. He has to submit a report
to the president regarding the administration of such areas, annually or
whenever so required by the president. The executive power of the
Centre extends to giving directions to the states regarding the
administration of such areas.
3.  Tribes Advisory Council: Each state having scheduled areas has to
establish a tribes advisory council to advise on welfare and
advancement of the scheduled tribes. It is to consist of 20 members,
three-fourths of whom are to be the representatives of the scheduled
tribes in the state legislative assembly. A similar council can also be
established in a state having scheduled tribes but not scheduled areas
therein, if the president so directs.
4.  Law applicable to Scheduled Areas: The governor is empowered
to direct that any particular act of Parliament or the state legislature
does not apply to a scheduled area or apply with specified
modifications and exceptions. He can also make regulations for the
peace and good government of a scheduled area after consulting the
tribes advisory council. Such regulations may prohibit or restrict the
transfer of land by or among members of the scheduled tribes, regulate
the allotment of land to members of the scheduled tribes and regulate
the business of money-lending in relation to the scheduled tribes. Also,
a regulation may repeal or amend any act of Parliament or the state
legislature, which is applicable to a scheduled area. But, all such
regulations require the assent of the president.
The Constitution requires the president to appoint a commission to report
on the administration of the scheduled areas and the welfare of the
scheduled tribes in the states. He can appoint such a commission at any
time but compulsorily after ten years of the commencement of the
Constitution. Hence, a commission was appointed in 1960. It was headed
by U.N. Dhebar and submitted its report in 1961. After four decades, the
second commission was appointed in 2002 under the chairmanship of Dilip
Singh Bhuria. It submitted its report in 2004.
ADMINISTRATION OF TRIBAL AREAS
The Constitution, under Sixth Schedule, contains special provisions for the
administration of tribal areas in the four north-eastern states of Assam,
Meghalaya, Tripura and Mizoram. The rationality behind the special
arrangements in respect of only these four states lies in the following:
“The tribes in Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura and Mizoram have not
assimilated much the life and ways of the other people in these states.
These areas have hitherto been anthropological specimens. The tribal
people in other parts of India have more or less adopted the culture of
the majority of the people in whose midst they live. The tribes in
Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura and Mizoram, on the other hand, still have
their roots in their own culture, customs and civilization. These areas
are, therefore, treated differently by the Constitution and sizeable
amount of autonomy has been given to these people for selfgovernment.3
 ”
The various features of administration contained in the Sixth Schedule
are as follows:
1.  The tribal areas in the four states of Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura and
Mizoram have been constituted as autonomous districts4
. But, they do
not fall outside the executive authority of the state concerned.
2.  The governor is empowered to organise and re-organise the
autonomous districts. Thus, he can increase or decrease their areas or
change their names or define their boundaries and so on.
3.  If there are different tribes in an autonomous district, the governor
can divide the district into several autonomous regions.
4.  Each autonomous district has a district council consisting of 30
members, of whom four are nominated by the governor and the
remaining 26 are elected on the basis of adult franchise. The elected
members hold office for a term of five years (unless the council is
dissolved earlier) and nominated members hold office during the
pleasure of the governor. Each autonomous region also has a separate
regional council.
5.  The district and regional councils administer the areas under their
jurisdiction. They can make laws on certain specified matters like land,
forests, canal water, shifting cultivation, village administration,
inheritance of property, marriage and divorce, social customs and so
on. But all such laws require the assent of the governor.
6.  The district and regional councils within their territorial
jurisdictions can constitute village councils or courts for trial of suits
and cases between the tribes. They hear appeals from them. The
jurisdiction of high court over these suits and cases is specified by the
governor.
7.  The district council can establish, construct or manage primary
schools, dispensaries, markets, ferries, fisheries, roads and so on in the
district. It can also make regulations for the control of money lending
and trading by nontribals. But, such regulations require the assent of
the governor.
8.  The district and regional councils are empowered to assess and
collect land revenue and to impose certain specified taxes.
9.  The acts of Parliament or the state legislature do not apply to
autonomous districts and autonomous regions or apply with specified
modifications and exceptions5
 .
10.  The governor can appoint a commission to examine and report on
any matter relating to the administration of the autonomous districts or
regions. He may dissolve a district or regional council on the
recommendation of the commission.

42 Election Commission
The Election Commission is a permanent and an independent body
established by the Constitution of India directly to ensure free and fair
elections in the country. Article 324 of the Constitution provides that the
power of superintendence, direction and control of elections to parliament,
state legislatures, the office of president of India and the office of vicepresident of India shall be vested in the election commission. Thus, the
Election Commission is an all-India body in the sense that it is common to
both the Central government and the state governments.
It must be noted here that the election commission is not concerned with
the elections to panchayats and municipalities in the states. For this, the
Constitution of India provides for a separate State Election Commission1
 .
COMPOSITION
Article 324 of the Constitution has made the following provisions with
regard to the composition of election commission:
1.  The Election Commission shall consist of the chief election
commissioner and such number of other election commissioners, if
any, as the president may from time to time fix.
2.  The appointment of the chief election commissioner and other
election commissioners shall be made by the president.
3.  When any other election commissioner is so appointed, the chief
election commissioner shall act as the chairman of the election
commission.
4.  The president may also appoint after consultation with the election
commission such regional commissioners as he may consider
necessary to assist the election commission.
5.  The conditions of service and tenure of office of the election
commissioners and the regional commissioners shall be determined by
the president.
Since its inception in 1950 and till 15 October 1989, the election
commission functioned as a single member body consisting of the Chief
Election Commissioner. On 16 October 1989, the president appointed two
more election commissioners to cope with the increased work of the
election commission on account of lowering of the voting age from 21 to 18
years.2 Thereafter, the Election Commission functioned as a multimember
body consisting of three election commissioners. However, the two posts of
election commissioners were abolished in January 1990 and the Election
Commission was reverted to the earlier position. Again in October 1993,
the president appointed two more election commissioners. Since then and
till today, the Election Commission has been functioning as a multi-member
body consisting of three election commissioners.
The chief election commissioner and the two other election
commissioners have equal powers and receive equal salary, allowances and
other perquisites, which are similar to those of a judge of the Supreme
Court.3
In case of difference of opinion amongst the Chief Election
Commissioner and/or two other election commissioners, the matter is
decided by the Commission by majority.
They hold office for a term of six years or until they attain the age of 65
years, whichever is earlier. They can resign at any time or can also be
removed before the expiry of their term.
INDEPENDENCE
Article 324 of the Constitution has made the following provisions to
safeguard and ensure the independent and impartial functioning of the
Election Commission:
1.  The chief election commissioner is provided with the security of
tenure. He cannot be removed from his office except in same manner
and on the same grounds as a judge of the Supreme Court. In other
words, he can be removed by the president on the basis of a resolution
passed to that effect by both the Houses of Parliament with special
majority, either on the ground of proved misbehaviour or incapacity.
Thus, he does not hold his office till the pleasure of the president,
though he is appointed by him.
2.  The service conditions of the chief election commissioner cannot be
varied to his disadvantage after his appointment.
3.  Any other election commissioner or a regional commissioner
cannot be removed from office except on the recommendation of the
chief election commissioner.
Though the constitution has sought to safeguard and ensure the
independence and impartiality of the Election Commission, some flaws can
be noted, viz.,
1.  The Constitution has not prescribed the qualifications (legal,
educational, administrative or judicial) of the members of the Election
Commission.
2.  The Constitution has not specified the term of the members of the
Election Commission.
3.  The Constitution has not debarred the retiring election
commissioners from any further appointment by the government.
POWERS AND FUNCTIONS
The powers and functions of the Election Commission with regard to
elections to the Parliament, state legislatures and offices of President and
Vice-President can be classified into three categories, viz,
1.  Administrative
2.  Advisory
3.  Quasi-Judicial
In detail, these powers and functions are:
1.  To determine the territorial areas of the electoral constituencies
throughout the country on the basis of the Delimitation Commission
Act of Parliament.4
2.  To prepare and periodically revise electoral rolls and to register all
eligible voters.
3.  To notify the dates and schedules of elections and to scrutinise
nomination papers.
4.  To grant recognition to political parties and allot election symbols
to them.
5.  To act as a court for settling disputes related to granting of
recognition to political parties and allotment of election symbols to
them.
6.  To appoint officers for inquiring into disputes relating to electoral
arrangements.
7.  To determine the code of conduct to be observed by the parties and
the candidates at the time of elections.
8.  To prepare a roster for publicity of the policies of the political
parties on radio and TV in times of elections.
9.  To advise the president on matters relating to the disqualifications
of the members of Parliament.
10.  To advise the governor on matters relating to the disqualifications
of the members of state legislature.
11.  To cancel polls in the event of rigging, booth capturing, violence
and other irregularities.
12.  To request the president or the governor for requisitioning the staff
necessary for conducting elections.
13.  To supervise the machinery of elections throughout the country to
ensure free and fair elections.
14.  To advise the president whether elections can be held in a state
under president’s rule in order to extend the period of emergency after
one year.
15.  To register political parties for the purpose of elections and grant
them the status of national or state parties on the basis of their poll
performance5
 .
The Election Commission is assisted by deputy election commissioners.
They are drawn from the civil service and appointed by the commission
with tenure system. They are assisted, in turn, by the secretaries, joint
secretaries, deputy secretaries and under secretaries posted in the secretariat
of the commission.
At the state level, the Election Commission is assisted by the chief
electoral officer who is appointed by the chief election commissioner in
consultation with the state government. Below this, at the district level, the
collector acts as the district returning officer. He appoints a returning officer
for every constituency in the district and presiding officer for every polling
booth in the constituency.

43 Union Public Service Commission
The Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) is the central recruiting
agency in India. It is an independent constitutional body in the sense that it
has been directly created by the Constitution. Articles 315 to 323 in Part
XIV of the Constitution contain elaborate provisions regarding the
composition, appointment and removal of members along with the
independence, powers and functions of the UPSC.
COMPOSITION
The UPSC consists of a chairman and other members appointed by the
president of India. The Constitution, without specifying the strength of the
Commission has left the matter to the discretion of the president, who
determines its composition. Usually, the Commission consists of nine to
eleven members including the chairman. Further, no qualifications are
prescribed for the Commission’s membership except that one-half of the
members of the Commission should be such persons who have held office
for at least ten years either under the Government of India or under the
government of a state. The Constitution also authorises the president to
determine the conditions of service of the chairman and other members of
the Commission.
The chairman and members of the Commission hold office for a term of
six years or until they attain the age of 65 years, whichever is earlier.
However, they can relinquish their offices at any time by addressing their
resignation to the president. They can also be removed before the expiry of
their term by the president in the manner as provided in the Constitution.
The President can appoint one of the members of the UPSC as an acting
chairman in the following two circumstances1
 :
(a)  When the office of the chairman falls vacant; or
(b)  When the chairman is unable to perform his functions due to
absence or some other reason.
The acting chairman functions till a person appointed as chairman enters
on the duties of the office or till the chairman is able to resume his duties.
REMOVAL
The President can remove the chairman or any other member of UPSC from
the office under the following circumstances:
(a)  If he is adjudged an insolvent (that is, has gone bankrupt);
(b)  If he engages, during his term of office, in any paid employment
outside the duties of his office; or
(c)  If he is, in the opinion of the president, unfit to continue in office
by reason of infirmity of mind or body.
In addition to these, the president can also remove the chairman or any
other member of UPSC for misbehaviour. However, in this case, the
president has to refer the matter to the Supreme Court for an enquiry. If the
Supreme Court, after the enquiry, upholds the cause of removal and advises
so, the president can remove the chairman or a member. Under the
provisions of the Constitution, the advise tendered by the Supreme Court in
this regard is binding on the president. During the course of enquiry by the
Supreme Court, the president can suspend the chairman or the member of
UPSC.
Defining the term ‘misbehaviour’ in this context, the Constitution states
that the chairman or any other member of the UPSC is deemed to be guilty
of misbehaviour if he (a) is concerned or interested in any contract or
agreement made by the Government of India or the government of a state,
or (b) participates in any way in the profit of such contract or agreement or
in any benefit therefrom otherwise than as a member and in common with
other members of an incorporated company.
INDEPENDENCE
The Constitution has made the following provisions to safeguard and ensure
the independent and impartial functioning of the UPSC:
(a)  The chairman or a member of the UPSC can be removed from
office by the president only in the manner and on the grounds
mentioned in the Constitution. Therefore, they enjoy security of
tenure.
(b)  The conditions of service of the chairman or a member, though
determined by the president, cannot be varied to his disadvantage after
his appointment.
(c)  The entire expenses including the salaries, allowances and
pensions of the chairman and members of the UPSC are charged on the
Consolidated Fund of India. Thus, they are not subject to vote of
Parliament.
(d)  The chairman of UPSC (on ceasing to hold office) is not eligible
for further employment in the Government of India or a state2
 .
(e)  A member of UPSC (on ceasing to hold office) is eligible for
appointment as the chairman of UPSC or a State Public Service
Commission (SPSC), but not for any other employment in the
Government of India or a state3
 .
(f)  The chairman or a member of UPSC is (after having completed his
first term) not eligible for reappointment to that office (i.e., not eligible
for second term).
FUNCTIONS
The UPSC performs the following functions:
(a)  It conducts examinations for appointments to the all-India services,
Central services and public services of the centrally administered
territories.
(b)  It assists the states (if requested by two or more states to do so) in
framing and operating schemes of joint recruitment for any services
for which candidates possessing special qualifications are required.
(c)  It serves all or any of the needs of a state on the request of the state
governor and with the approval of the president of India.
(d)  It is consulted on the following matters related to personnel
management:
(i) All matters relating to methods of recruitment to civil
services and for civil posts.
(ii) The principles to be followed in making appointments to
civil services and posts and in making promotions and
transfers from one service to another.
(iii) The suitability of candidates for appointments to civil
services and posts; for promotions and transfers from one
service to another; and appointments by transfer or
deputation. The concerned departments make
recommendations for promotions and request the UPSC to
ratify them.
(iv) All disciplinary matters affecting a person serving under the
Government of India in a civil capacity including memorials
or petitions relating to such matters. These include:
–  Censure (Severe disapproval)
–  Withholding of increments
–  Withholding of promotions
–  Recovery of pecuniary loss
–  Reduction to lower service or rank (Demotion)
–  Compulsory retirement
–  Removal from service
–  Dismissal from service4
(v) Any claim for reimbursement of legal expenses incurred by
a civil servant in defending legal proceedings instituted
against him in respect of acts done in the execution of his
official duties.
(vi) Any claim for the award of a pension in respect of injuries
sustained by a person while serving under the Government
of India and any question as to the amount of any such
award.
(vii) Matters of temporary appointments for period exceeding
one year and on regularisation of appointments.
(viii) Matters related to grant of extension of service and reemployment of certain retired civil servants.
(ix) Any other matter related to personnel management.
The Supreme Court has held that if the government fails to consult UPSC
in the matters (mentioned above), the aggrieved public servant has no
remedy in a court. In other words, the court held that any irregularity in
consultation with the UPSC or acting without consultation does not
invalidate the decision of the government. Thus, the provision is directory
and not mandatory. Similarly, the court held that a selection by the UPSC
does not confer any right to the post upon the candidate. However, the
government is to act fairly and without arbitrariness or mala fides.
The additional functions relating to the services of the Union can be
conferred on UPSC by the Parliament. It can also place the personnel
system of any authority, corporate body or public institution within the
jurisdiction of the UPSC. Hence the jurisdiction of UPSC can be extended
by an act made by the Parliament.
The UPSC presents, annually, to the president a report on its
performance. The President places this report before both the Houses of
Parliament, along with a memorandum explaining the cases where the
advice of the Commission was not accepted and the reasons for such nonacceptance. All such cases of non-acceptance must be approved by the
Appointments Committee of the Union cabinet. An individual ministry or
department has no power to reject the advice of the UPSC.
LIMITATIONS
The following matters are kept outside the functional jurisdiction of the
UPSC. In other words, the UPSC is not consulted on the following matters:
(a)  While making reservations of appointments or posts in favour of
any backward class of citizens.
(b)  While taking into consideration the claims of scheduled castes and
scheduled tribes in making appointments to services and posts.
(c)  With regard to the selections for chairmanship or membership of
commissions or tribunals, posts of the highest diplomatic nature and a
bulk of group C and group D services.
(d)  With regard to the selection for temporary or officiating
appointment to a post if the person appointed is not likely to hold the
post for more than a year.
The president can exclude posts, services and matters from the purview
of the UPSC. The Constitution states that the president, in respect to the allIndia services and Central services and posts may make regulations
specifying the matters in which, it shall not be necessary for UPSC to be
consulted. But all such regulations made by the president shall be laid
before each House of Parliament for at least 14 days. The Parliament can
amend or repeal them.
ROLE
The Constitution visualises the UPSC to be the ‘watch-dog of merit system’
in India. It is concerned with the recruitment to the all-India services and
Central services–group A and group B and advises the government, when
consulted, on promotion and disciplinary matters. It is not concerned with
the classification of services, pay and service conditions, cadre
management, training, and so on. These matters are handled by the
Department of Personnel and Training–one of the three departments of the
Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions5
. Therefore, UPSC
is only a central recruiting agency while the Department of Personnel and
Training is the central personnel agency in India.
The role of UPSC is not only limited, but also recommendations made by
it are only of advisory nature and hence, not binding on the government. It
is upto the Union government to accept or reject that advise. The only
safeguard is the answerability of the government to the Parliament for
departing from the recommendation of the Commission. Further, the
government can also make rules which regulate the scope of the advisory
functions of UPSC6
 .
The emergence of Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) in 1964 affected
the role of UPSC in disciplinary matters. This is because both are consulted
by the government while taking disciplinary action against a civil servant.
The problem arises when the two bodies tender conflicting advise.
However, the UPSC, being an independent constitutional body, has an edge
over the CVC, which is created by an executive resolution of the
Government of India and conferred a statutory status in October 2003.

44 State Public Service Commission
Parallel to the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) at the Centre,
there is a State Public Service Commission (SPSC) in a state. The same set
of Articles (i.e., 315 to 323 in Part XIV) of the Constitution also deal with
the composition, appointment and removal of members, power and
functions and independence of a SPSC.
COMPOSITION
A State Public Service Commission consists of a chairman and other
members appointed by the governor of the state. The Constitution does not
specify the strength of the Commission but has left the matter to the
discretion of the Governor. Further, no qualifications are prescribed for the
commission’s membership except that one-half of the members of the
commission should be such persons who have held office for at least ten
years either under the government of India or under the Government of a
state. The Constitution also authorises the governor to determine the
conditions of service of the chairman and members of the Commission.
The chairman and members of the Commission hold office for a term of
six years or until they attain the age of 62 years1
, whichever is earlier (in
the case of UPSC, the age limit is 65 years). However, they can relinquish
their offices at any time by addressing their resignation to the governor.
The governor can appoint one of the members of the SPSC as an acting
chairman in the following two circumstances2
 :
(a)  When the office of the chairman falls vacant; or
(b)  When the chairman is unable to perform his functions due to
absence or some other reason.
The acting chairman functions till the person appointed as chairman
enters on the duties of the office or till the chairman is able to resume his
duties.
REMOVAL
Although the chairman and members of a SPSC are appointed by the
governor, they can be removed only by the president (and not by the
governor). The president can remove them on the same grounds and in the
same manner as he can remove a chairman or a member of the UPSC. Thus,
he can remove him under the following circumstances:
(a)  If he is adjudged an insolvent (i.e., has gone bankrupt); or
(b)  If he engages, during his term of office, in any paid employment
outside the duties of his office; or
(c)  If he is, in the opinion of the president, unfit to continue in office
by reason of infirmity of mind or body3
 .
In addition to these, the president can also remove the chairman or any
other member of SPSC for misbehaviour. However, in this case, the
president has to refer the matter to the Supreme Court for an enquiry. If the
Supreme Court, after the enquiry, upholds the cause of removal and advises
so, the president can remove the chairman or a member. Under the
provisions of the Constitution, the advise tendered by the Supreme Court in
this regard is binding on the president. However, during the course of
enquiry by the Supreme Court, the governor can suspend the concerned
chairman or member, pending the final removal order of the president on
receipt of the report of the Supreme Court.
Further, the Constitution has also defined the term ‘misbehaviour’ in this
context. The Constitution states that the chairman or any other member of a
SPSC is deemed to be guilty of misbehaviour, if he (a) is concerned or
interested in any contract or agreement made by the Government of India or
the government of a state, or (b) participates in any way in the profit of such
contract or agreement or in any benefit therefrom otherwise than as a
member and in common with other members of an incorporated company.
INDEPENDENCE
As in the case of UPSC, the Constitution has made the following provisions
to safeguard and ensure the independent and impartial functioning of a
SPSC:
(a)  The chairman or a member of a SPSC can be removed from office
by the president only in the manner and on the grounds mentioned in
the Constitution. Therefore, they enjoy the security of tenure.
(b)  The conditions of service of the chairman or a member, though
determined by the governor, cannot be varied to his disadvantage after
his appointment.
(c)  The entire expense including the salaries, allowances and pensions
of the chairman and members of a SPSC are charged on the
consolidated fund of the state. Thus, they are not subject to vote of the
state legislature.
(d)  The chairman of a SPSC (on ceasing to hold office) is eligible for
appointment as the chairman or a member of the UPSC or as the
chairman of any other SPSC, but not for any other employment under
the Government of India or a state.
(e)  A member of a SPSC (on ceasing to hold office) is eligible for
appointment as the chairman or a member of the UPSC, or as the
chairman of that SPSC or any other SPSC, but not for any other
employment under the Government of India or a state.
(f)  The chairman or a member of a SPSC is (after having completed
his first term) not eligible for reappointment to that office (that is, not
eligible for second term).
FUNCTIONS
A SPSC performs all those functions in respect of the state services as the
UPSC does in relation to the Central services:
(a)  It conducts examinations for appointments to the services of the
state.
(b)  It is consulted on the following matters related to personnel
management:
(i) All matters relating to methods of recruitment to civil
services and for civil posts.
(ii) The principles to be followed in making appointments to
civil services and posts and in making promotions and
transfers from one service to another.
(iii) The suitability of candidates for appointments to civil
services and posts; for promotions and transfers from one
service to another; and appointments by transfer or
deputation. The concerned departments make
recommendations for promotions and request the SPSC to
ratify them.
(iv) All disciplinary matters affecting a person serving under the
government of the state in a civil capacity including
memorials or petitions relating to such matters. These
include:
–  Censure (severe disapproval)
–  Withholding of increments
–  Withholding of promotions
–  Recovery of pecuniary loss
–  Reduction to lower service or rank (demotion)
–  Compulsory retirement
–  Removal from service
–  Dismissal from service4
(v) Any claim for reimbursement of legal expenses incurred by
a civil servant in defending legal proceedings instituted
against him in respect of acts done in the execution of his
official duties.
(vi) Any claim for the award of a pension in respect of injuries
sustained by a person while serving under the government
of the state and any question as to the amount of any such
award.
(vii) Any other matter related to the personnel management.
The Supreme Court has held that if the government fails to consult the
SPSC in these matters, the aggrieved public servant has no remedy in a
court. In other words, the court held that any irregularity in consultation
with the SPSC or acting without consultation does not invalidate the
decision of the government. Thus, the provision is directory and not
mandatory. Similarly, the court held that a selection by the SPSC does not
confer any right to the post upon the candidate. However, the government is
to act fairly and without arbitrariness or malafides.
The additional functions relating to the services of the state can be
conferred on SPSC by the state legislature. It can also place the personnel
system of any local authority, corporate body or public institution within the
jurisdiction of the SPSC. Hence the jurisdiction of SPSC can be extended
by an Act made by the state legislature.
The SPSC presents, annually, to the governor a report on its performance.
The governor places this report before both the Houses of the state
legislature, along with a memorandum explaining the cases where the
advice of the Commission was not accepted and the reasons for such nonacceptance.
LIMITATIONS
The following matters are kept outside the functional jurisdiction of the
SPSC. In other words, the SPSC is not consulted on the following matters:
(a)  While making reservations of appointments or posts in favour of
any backward class of citizens.
(b)  While taking into consideration the claims of scheduled castes and
scheduled tribes in making appointments to services and posts.
The governor can exclude posts, services and matters from the purview
of the SPSC. The Constitution states that the governor, in respect to the
state services and posts may make regulations specifying the matters in
which, it shall not be necessary for SPSC to be consulted. But all such
regulations made by the governor shall be laid before each House of the
state legislature for at least 14 days. The state legislature can amend or
repeal them.
ROLE
The Constitution visualises the SPSC to be the ‘watchdog of merit system’
in the state. It is concerned with the recruitment to the state services and
advises the government, when consulted, on promotion and disciplinary
matters. It is not concerned with the classification of services, pay and
service conditions, cadre management, training and so on. These matters are
handled by the Department of Personnel or the General Administration
Department. Therefore, the SPSC is only a central recruiting agency in the
state while the Department of Personnel or the General Administration
Department is the central personnel agency in the state.
The role of SPSC is not only limited, but also recommendations made by
it are only of advisory nature and hence, not binding on the government. It
is up to the state government to accept or reject that advice. The only
safeguard is the answerability of the government to the state legislature for
departing from the recommendation of the Commission. Further, the
government can also make rules which regulate the scope of the advisory
functions of SPSC5
 .
Also, the emergence of State Vigilance Commission (SVC) in 1964
affected the role of SPSC in disciplinary matters. This is because both are
consulted by the government while taking disciplinary action against a civil
servant. The problem arises when the two bodies tender conflicting advice.
However, the SPSC, being an independent constitutional body, has an edge
over the SVC.
Finally, the SPSC is consulted by the governor while framing rules for
appointment to judicial service of the state other than the posts of district
judges. In this regard, the concerned state high court is also consulted.
JOINT STATE PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION
The Constitution makes a provision for the establishment of a Joint State
Public Service Commission (JSPSC) for two or more states. While the
UPSC and the SPSC are created directly by the Constitution, a JSPSC can
be created by an act of Parliament on the request of the state legislatures
concerned. Thus, a JSPSC is a statutory and not a constitutional body. The
two states of Punjab and Haryana had a JSPSC for a short period, after the
creation of Haryana out of Punjab in 1966.
The chairman and members of a JSPSC are appointed by the president.
They hold office for a term of six years or until they attain the age of 62
years, whichever is earlier. They can be suspended or removed by the
president. They can also resign from their offices at any time by submitting
their resignation letters to the president.
The number of members of a JSPSC and their conditions of service are
determined by the president.
A JSPSC presents its annual performance report to each of the concerned
state governors. Each governor places the report before the state legislature.
The UPSC can also serve the needs of a state on the request of the state
governor and with the approval of the president.
As provided by the Government of India Act of 1919, a Central Public
Service Commission was set up in 1926 and entrusted with the task of
recruiting civil servants. The Government of India Act of 1935 provided for
the establishment of not only a Federal Public Service Commission but also
a Provincial Public Service Commission and Joint Public Service
Commission for two or more provinces.

45 Finance Commission
Article 280 of the Constitution of India provides for a Finance
Commission as a quasi judicial body. It is constituted by the president of
India every fifth year or at such earlier time as he considers necessary.
COMPOSITION
The Finance Commission consists of a chairman and four other members to
be appointed by the president. They hold office for such period as specified
by the president in his order. They are eligible for reappointment.
The Constitution authorises the Parliament to determine the
qualifications of members of the commission and the manner in which they
should be selected. Accordingly, the Parliament has specified the
qualifications of the chairman and members of the com-mission1
. The
chairman should be a person having experience in public affairs and the
four other members should be selected from amongst the following:
1.  A judge of high court or one qualified to be appointed as one.
2.  A person who has specialised knowledge of finance and accounts of
the government.
3.  A person who has wide experience in financial matters and in
administration.
4.  A person who has special knowledge of economics.
FUNCTIONS
The Finance Commission is required to make recommendations to the
president of India on the following matters:
1.  The distribution of the net proceeds of taxes to be shared between
the Centre and the states, and the allocation between the states of the
respective shares of such proceeds.
2.  The principles that should govern the grants-in-aid to the states by
the Centre (i.e., out of the consolidated fund of India).
3.  The measures needed to augment the consolidated fund of a state to
supplement the resources of the panchayats and the municipalities in
the state on the basis of the recommendations made by the state
finance commission2
 .
4.  Any other matter referred to it by the president in the interests of
sound finance.
Till 1960, the commission also suggested the grants given to the States of
Assam, Bihar, Odisha and West Bengal in lieu of assignment of any share
of the net proceeds in each year of export duty on jute and jute products.
These grants were to be given for a temporary period of ten years from the
commencement of the Constitution.
The commission submits its report to the president. He lays it before both
the Houses of Parliament along with an explanatory memorandum as to the
action taken on its recommendations.
ADVISORY ROLE
It must be clarified here that the recommendations made by the Finance
Commission are only of advisory nature and hence, not binding on the
government. It is up to the Union government to implement its
recommendations on granting money to the states.
To put it in other words, ‘It is nowhere laid down in the Constitution that
the recommendations of the commission shall be binding upon the
Government of India or that it would give rise to a legal right in favour of
the beneficiary states to receive the money recommended to be offered to
them by the Commission’3
 .
As rightly observed by Dr. P.V. Rajamannar, the Chairman of the Fourth
Finance Commission, “Since the Finance Commission is a constitutional
body expected to be quasijudicial, its recommendations should not be
turned down by the Government of India unless there are very compelling
reasons”.
The Constitution of India envisages the Finance commission as the
balancing wheel of fiscal federalism in India. However, till 2014, its role in
the Centre-state fiscal relations was undermined by the erstwhile Planning
Commission, a non-constitutional and a non-statutory body. Dr. P.V.
Rajamannar, the Chairman of the Fourth Finance commission, highlighted
the overlapping of functions and responsibilities between the Finance
Commission and the erstwhile Planning Commission in federal fiscal transfers.4
In 2015, the Planning Commission was replaced by a new body called
NITI Aayog (National Institution for Transforming India).

46 Goods and Services Tax Council
ESTABLISHMENT OF THE COUNCIL
The 101st Amendment Act of 2016 paved the way for the introduction of a
new tax regime (i.e. goods and services tax - GST) in the country. The
smooth and efficient administration of this tax requires co-operation and
coordination between the centre and the states. In order to facilitate this
consultation process, the amendment provided for the establishment of a
Goods and Services Tax Council or the GST Council.
The amendment inserted a new Article 279-A in the Constitution. This
Article empowered the President to constitute a GST Council by an order1
.
Accordingly, the President issued the order in 2016 and constituted the
Council2
 .
The Secretariat of the Council is located at New Delhi. The Union
Revenue Secretary3
 acts as the ex-officio Secretary to the Council.
VISION AND MISSION OF THE COUNCIL
While discharging its functions, the Council is to be guided by the need for
a harmonised structure of GST and the development of a harmonised
national market for goods and services. Further, the Council has to
determine the procedure in the performance of its functions.
The vision and mission of the Council are as follows:
Vision: To establish the highest standards of co-operative federation in the
functioning of the Council, which is the first constitutional federal body
vested with powers to take all major decisions relating to GST.

one-third of the total votes cast in that meeting.
(ii) The votes of all the state governments combined shall have a
weightage of two-thirds of the total votes cast in that
meeting.

47 National Commission for SCs
The National Commission for Scheduled Castes (SCs) is a constitutional
body in the sense that it is directly established by Article 338 of the
Constitu-tion1
. On the other hand, the other national commissions like the
National Commission for Women (1992), the National Commission for
Minorities (1993), the National Human Rights Commission (1993) and the
National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (2007) are statutory
bodies in the sense that they are established by acts of the Parliament2
 .
EVOLUTION OF THE COMMISSION
Originally, Article 338 of the Constitution provided for the appointment of
a Special Officer for Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs) to
investigate all matters relating to the constitutional safeguards for the SCs
and STs and to report to the President on their working3
. He was designated
as the Commissioner for SCs and STs and assigned the said duty.
In 1978, the Government (through a Resolution) set up a non-statutory
multimember Commission for SCs and STs; the Office of Commissioner for
SCs and STs also continued to exist.
In 1987, the Government (through another Resolution) modified the
functions of the Commission and renamed it as the National Commission
for SCs and STs
4
 .
Later, the 65th Constitutional Amendment Act of 19905 provided for the
establishment of a high level multi-member National Commission for SCs
and STs in the place of a single Special Officer for SCs and STs. This
constitutional body replaced the Commissioner for SCs and STs as well as
the Commission set up under the Resolution of 1987.
Again, the 89th Constitutional Amendment Act of 20036 bifurcated the
combined National Commission for SCs and STs into two separate bodies,
namely, National Commission for Scheduled Castes (under Article 338) and
National Commission for Scheduled Tribes (under Article 338-A).
The separate National Commission for SCs came into existence in 2004.
It consists of a chairperson, a vice-chairperson and three other members.
They are appointed by the President by warrant under his hand and seal.
Their conditions of service and tenure of office are also determined by the
President7
 .
FUNCTIONS OF THE COMMISSION
The functions of the Commission are:
(a)  To investigate and monitor all matters relating to the constitutional
and other legal safeguards for the SCs and to evaluate their working;
(b)  To inquire into specific complaints with respect to the deprivation
of rights and safeguards of the SCs;
(c)  To participate and advise on the planning process of socioeconomic development of the SCs and to evaluate the progress of their
development under the Union or a state;
(d)  To present to the President, annually and at such other times as it
may deem fit, reports upon the working of those safeguards;
(e)  To make recommendations as to the measures that should be taken
by the Union or a state for the effective implementation of those
safeguards and other measures for the protection, welfare and socioeconomic development of the SCs; and
(f)  To discharge such other functions in relation to the protection,
welfare and development and advancement of the SCs as the president
may specify.
REPORT OF THE COMMISSION
The commission presents an annual report to the president. It can also
submit a report as and when it thinks necessary.
The President places all such reports before the Parliament, along with a
memorandum explaining the action taken on the recommendations made by
the Commission. The memorandum should also contain the reasons for the
non-acceptance of any of such recommendations.
The President also forwards any report of the Commission pertaining to a
state government to the state governor. The governor places it before the
state legislature, along with a memorandum explaining the action taken on
the recommendations of the Commission. The memorandum should also
contain the reasons for the non-acceptance of any of such
recommendations.
POWERS OF THE COMMISSION
The Commission is vested with the power to regulate its own procedure.
The Commission, while investigating any matter or inquiring into any
complaint, has all the powers of a civil court trying a suit and in particular
in respect of the following matters:
(a)  summoning and enforcing the attendance of any person from any
part of India and examining him on oath;
(b)  requiring the discovery and production of any document;
(c)  receiving evidence on affidavits;
(d)  requisitioning any public record from any court or office;
(e)  issuing summons for the examination of witnesses and documents;
and
(f)  any other matter which the President may determine.
The Central government and the state governments are required to
consult the Commission on all major policy matters affecting the SCs.
The Commission is also required to discharge similar functions with
regard to the Anglo-Indian Community as it does with respect to the SCs. In
other words, the Commission has to investigate all matters relating to the
constitutional and other legal safeguards for the Anglo-Indian Community
and report to the President upon their working8
 .
Till 2018, the commission was also required to discharge similar
functions with regard to the other backward classes (OBCs). It was relieved
from this responsibility by the 102ndAmendment Act of 2018.

48 National Commission for STs
Like the National Commission for Schedules Castes (SCs), the National
Commission for Scheduled Tribes (STs) is also a constitutional body in the
sense that it is directly established by Article 338-A of the Constitution1
 .
SEPARATE COMMISSION FOR STS
The National Commission for SCs and STs came into being consequent
upon passing of the 65th Constitutional Amendment Act of 19902
. The
Commission was established under Article 338 of the Constitution with the
objective of monitoring all the safeguards provided for the SCs and STs
under the Constitution or other laws3
 .
Geographically and culturally, the STs are different from the SCs and
their problems are also different from those of SCs. In 1999, a new Ministry
of Tribal Affairs was created to provide a sharp focus to the welfare and
development of the STs. It was felt necessary that the Ministry of Tribal
Affairs should coordinate all activities relating to the STs as it would not be
administratively feasible for the Ministry of Social Justice and
Empowerment to perform this role4
 .
Hence, in order to safeguard the interests of the STs more effectively, it
was proposed to set up a separate National Commission for STs by
bifurcating the existing combined National Commission for SCs and STs.
This was done by passing the 89th Constitutional Amendment Act of 20035
.
This Act further amended Article 338 and inserted a new Article 338-A in
the Constitution.
The separate National Commission for STs came into existence in 2004.
It consists of a chairperson, a vice-chairperson and three other members.
They are appointed by the President by warrant under his hand and seal.
Their conditions of service and tenure of office are also determined by the
President6
 .
FUNCTIONS OF THE COMMISSION
The functions of the Commission are:
(a)  To investigate and monitor all matters relating to the constitutional
and other legal safeguards for the STs and to evaluate their working;
(b)  To inquire into specific complaints with respect to the deprivation
of rights and safeguards of the STs;
(c)  To participate and advise on the planning process of socioeconomic development of the STs and to evaluate the progress of their
development under the Union or a state;
(d)  To present to the President, annually and at such other times as it
may deem fit, reports upon the working of those safeguards;
(e)  To make recommendations as to the measures that should be taken
by the Union or a state for the effective implementation of those
safeguards and other measures for the protection, welfare and socioeconomic development of the STs; and
(f)  To discharge such other functions in relation to the protection,
welfare and development and advancement of the STs as the President
may specify.
OTHER FUNCTIONS OF THE COMMISSION
In 2005, the President specified the following other functions of the
Commission in relation to the protection, welfare and development and
advancement of the STs
7
 :
(i) Measures to be taken over conferring ownership rights in respect
of minor forest produce to STs living in forest areas
(ii) Measures to be taken to safeguard rights of the tribal
communities over mineral resources, water resources etc., as per
law
(iii) Measures to be taken for the development of tribals and to work
for more viable livelihood strategies
(iv) Measures to be taken to improve the efficacy of relief and
rehabilitation measures for tribal groups displaced by
development projects
(v) Measures to be taken to prevent alienation of tribal people from
land and to effectively rehabilitate such people in whose case
alienation has already taken place
(vi) Measures to be taken to elicit maximum cooperation and
involvement of tribal communities for protecting forests and
undertaking social afforestation
(vii) Measures to be taken to ensure full implementation of the
Provisions of Panchayats (Extension to the Scheduled Areas)
Act, 1996
(viii) Measures to be taken to reduce and ultimately eliminate the
practice of shifting cultivation by tribals that lead to their
continuous disempowerment and degradation of land and the
environment

49 National Commission for BCs
ESTABLISHMENT OF THE COMMISSION
In the Mandal case1
judgement (1992), the Supreme Court directed the
central government to constitute a permanent statutory body to examine the
complaints of underinclusion, over-inclusion or non-inclusion of any class
of citizens in the list of backward classes. Accordingly, the National
Commission for Backward Classes (NCBC) was set up in 19932
 .
Later, the 102nd Amendment Act of 2018 conferred a constitutional
status on the Commission. For this purpose, the amendment inserted a new
Article 338-B in the constitution. Hence, the Commission ceased to be a
statutory body and became a constitutional body3
 .
Further, the scope of functions assigned to the Commission is also
enlarged under the new dispensation. This was done in order to safeguard
the interests of the socially and educationally backward classes more effectively4
. In other words, the constitutional status of the new Commission is at
par with the National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC) and the
National Commission for Scheduled Tribes (NCST).
The Commission consists of a chairperson, a vice-chairperson and three
other members. They are appointed by the President by warrant under his
hand and seal. Their conditions of service and tenure of office are also
determined by the President5
 .
FUNCTIONS OF THE COMMISSION

and other legal safeguards for the socially and educationally backward
classes and to evaluate their working.
(b)  To inquire into specific complaints with respect to the deprivation
of rights and safeguards of the socially and educationally backward
classes.
(c)  To participate and advise on the socioeconomic development of
the socially and educationally backward classes and to evaluate the
progress of their development under the Union or a state.
(d)  To present to the President, annually and at such other times as it
may deem fit, reports upon the working of those safeguards.
(e)  To make recommendations as to the measures that should be taken
by the Union or a state for the effective implementation of those
safeguards and other measures for the protection, welfare and socioeconomic development of the socially and educationally backward
classes.

50 Special Officer for Linguistic
Minorities
CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS
Originally, the Constitution of India did not make any provision with
respect to the Special Officer for Linguistic Minorities1
. Later, the States
Reorganisation Commission (1953–55) made a recommendation in this
regard. Accordingly, the Seventh Constitutional Amendment Act of 1956
inserted a new Article 350-B in Part XVII of the Consti-tution2
. This article
contains the following provisions:
1.  There should be a Special Officer for Linguistic Minorities. He is to
be appointed by the President of India.
2.  It would be the duty of the Special Officer to investigate all matters
relating to the safeguards provided for linguistic minorities under the
Constitution3
. He would report to the President upon those matters at
such intervals as the President may direct. The President should place
all such reports before each House of Parliament and send to the
governments of the states concerned.
It must be noted here that the Constitution does not specify the
qualifications, tenure, salaries and allowances, service conditions and
procedure for removal of the Special Officer for Linguistic Minorities.
COMMISSIONER FOR LINGUISTIC MINORITIES
In pursuance of the provision of Article 350-B of the Constitution, the
office of the Special Officer for Linguistic Minorities was created in 1957.
He is designated as the Commissioner for Linguistic Minorities.

has three regional offices at Belgaum (Karnataka), Chennai (Tamil Nadu)
and Kolkata (West Bengal). Each is headed by an Assistant Commissioner.
The Commissioner is assisted at headquarters by Deputy Commissioner
and an Assistant Commissioner. He maintains liaison with the State
Governments and Union Territories through nodal officers appointed by
them.
At the Central level, the Commissioner falls under the Ministry of
Minority Affairs. Hence, he submits the annual reports or other reports to
the President through the Union Minority Affairs Minister4
 .
ROLE OF THE COMMISSIONER
The Commissioner takes up all the matters pertaining to the grievances
arising out of the non-implementation of the Constitutional and Nationally

its notice or are brought to its knowledge by the linguistic minority
individuals, groups, associations or organisations at the highest political and
administrative levels of the state governments and UT administrations and
recommends remedial actions to be taken5
 .
To promote and preserve linguistic minority groups, the Ministry of
Minority Affairs has requested the State Governments / Union Territories to
give wide publicity to the constitutional safeguards provided to linguistic
minorities and to take necessary administrative measures. The state
governments and UT Administrations were urged to accord priority to the
implementation of the scheme of safeguards for linguistic minorities. The
Commissioner launched a 10 point programme to lend fresh impetus to
Governmental efforts towards the preservation of the language and culture
of linguistic minorities6

51 Comptroller and Auditor General
of India
The Constitution of India (Article 148) provides for an independent office
of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG). He is the head of
the Indian Audit and Accounts Department1
. He is the guardian of the
public purse and controls the entire financial system of the country at both
the levels–the Centre and the state. His duty is to uphold the Constitution of
India and laws of Parliament in the field of financial administration. This is
the reason why Dr. B.R. Ambedkar said that the CAG shall be the most
important Officer under the Constitution of India2
. He is one of the
bulwarks of the democratic system of government in India; the others being
the Supreme Court, the Election Commission and the Union Public Service
Commission.
APPOINTMENT AND TERM
The CAG is appointed by the president of India by a warrant under his hand
and seal. The CAG, before taking over his office, makes and subscribes
before the president an oath or affirmation:
1.  to bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of India;
2.  to uphold the sovereignty and integrity of India;
3.  to duly and faithfully and to the best of his ability, knowledge and
judgement perform the duties of his office without fear or favour,
affection or ill-will; and
4.  to uphold the Constitution and the laws.
He holds office for a period of six years or upto the age of 65 years,
whichever is earlier. He can resign any time from his office by addressing
the resignation letter to the president. He can also be removed by the
president on same grounds and in the same manner as a judge of the
Supreme Court. In other words, he can be removed by the president on the
basis of a resolution passed to that effect by both the Houses of Parliament
with special majority, either on the ground of proved misbehaviour or
incapacity.
INDEPENDENCE
The Constitution has made the following provisions to safeguard and ensure
the independence of CAG:
1.  He is provided with the security of tenure. He can be removed by
the president only in accordance with the procedure mentioned in the
Constitution. Thus, he does not hold his office till the pleasure of the
president, though he is appointed by him.
2.  He is not eligible for further office, either under the Government of
India or of any state, after he ceases to hold his office.
3.  His salary and other service conditions are determined by the
Parliament. His salary is equal to that of a judge of the Supreme Court3
.
4.  Neither his salary nor his rights in respect of leave of absence,
pension or age of retirement can be altered to his disadvantage after his
appointment.
5.  The conditions of service of persons serving in the Indian Audit and
Accounts Department and the administrative powers of the CAG are
prescribed by the president after consultation with the CAG.
6.  The administrative expenses of the office of the CAG, including all
salaries, allowances and pensions of persons serving in that office are
charged upon the Consolidated Fund of India. Thus, they are not
subject to the vote of Parliament.
Further, no minister can represent the CAG in Parliament (both Houses)
and no minister can be called upon to take any responsibility for any actions
done by him.
DUTIES AND POWERS
The Constitution (Article 149) authorises the Parliament to prescribe the
duties and powers of the CAG in relation to the accounts of the Union and
of the states and of any other authority or body. Accordingly, the Parliament
enacted the CAG’s (Duties, Powers and Conditions of Service) act, 1971.
This Act was amended in 1976 to separate accounts from audit in the
Central government.
The duties and functions of the CAG as laid down by the Parliament and
the Constitution are:
1.  He audits the accounts related to all expenditure from the
Consolidated Fund of India, consolidated fund of each state and
consolidated fund of each union territory having a Legislative
Assembly.
2.  He audits all expenditure from the Contingency Fund of India and
the Public Account of India as well as the contingency fund of each
state and the public account of each state.
3.  He audits all trading, manufacturing, profit and loss accounts,
balance sheets and other subsidiary accounts kept by any department
of the Central Government and state governments.
4.  He audits the receipts and expenditure of the Centre and each state
to satisfy himself that the rules and procedures in that behalf are
designed to secure an effective check on the assessment, collection and
proper allocation of revenue.
5.  He audits the receipts and expenditure of the following:
(a)  All bodies and authorities substantially financed from the Central
or state revenues;
(b)  Government companies; and
(c)  Other corporations and bodies, when so required by related laws.
6.  He audits all transactions of the Central and state governments
related to debt, sinking funds, deposits, advances, suspense accounts
and remittance business. He also audits receipts, stock accounts and
others, with approval of the President, or when required by the
President.
7.  He audits the accounts of any other authority when requested by the
President or Governor. For example, the audit of local bodies.
8.  He advises the President with regard to prescription of the form in
which the accounts of the Centre and the states shall be kept (Article
150).
9.  He submits his audit reports relating to the accounts of the Centre to
President, who shall, in turn, place them before both the Houses of
Parliament (Article 151).
10.  He submits his audit reports relating to the accounts of a state to
governor, who shall, in turn, place them before the state legislature
(Article 151).
11.  He ascertains and certifies the net proceeds of any tax or duty
(Article 279). His certificate is final. The ‘net proceeds’ means the
proceeds of a tax or a duty minus the cost of collection.
12.  He acts as a guide, friend and philosopher of the Public Accounts
Committee of the Parliament.
13.  He compiles and maintains the accounts of state governments. In
1976, he was relieved of his responsibilities with regard to the
compilation and maintenance of accounts of the Central Government
due to the separation of accounts from audit, that is,
departmentalisation of accounts.
The CAG submits three audit reports to the President–audit report on
appropriation accounts, audit report on finance accounts, and audit report
on public undertakings. The President lays these reports before both the
Houses of Parliament. After this, the Public Accounts Committee examines
them and reports its findings to the Parliament.
The appropriation accounts compare the actual expenditure with the
expenditure sanctioned by the Parliament through the Appropriation Act,
while the finance accounts show the annual receipts and disbursements of
the Union government.
ROLE
The role of CAG is to uphold the Constitution of India and the laws of
Parliament in the field of financial administration. The accountability of the
executive (i.e., council of ministers) to the Parliament in the sphere of
financial administration is secured through audit reports of the CAG. The
CAG is an agent of the Parliament and conducts audit of expenditure on
behalf of the Parliament. Therefore, he is responsible only to the
Parliament.
The CAG has more freedom with regard to audit of expenditure than
with regard to audit of receipts, stores and stock. “Whereas in relation to
expenditure he decides the scope of audit and frames his own audit codes
and manuals, he has to proceed with the approval of the executive
government in relation to rules for the conduct of the other audits.”3a
The CAG has ‘to ascertain whether money shown in the accounts as
having been disbursed was legally available for and applicable to the
service or the purpose to which they have been applied or charged and
whether the expenditure conforms to the authority that governs it’. In
addition to this legal and regulatory audit, the CAG can also conduct the
propriety audit, that is, he can look into the ‘wisdom, faithfulness and
economy’ of government expenditure and comment on the wastefulness and
extravagance of such expenditure. However, unlike the legal and regulatory
audit, which is obligatory on the part of the CAG, the propriety audit is
discretionary.
The secret service expenditure is a limitation on the auditing role of the
CAG. In this regard, the CAG cannot call for particulars of expenditure
incurred by the executive agencies, but has to accept a certificate from the
competent administrative authority that the expenditure has been so
incurred under his authority.
The Constitution of India visualises the CAG to be Comptroller as well
as Auditor General. However, in practice, the CAG is fulfilling the role of
an Auditor-General only and not that of a Comptroller. In other words, ‘the
CAG has no control over the issue of money from the consolidated fund
and many departments are authorised to draw money by issuing cheques
without specific authority from the CAG, who is concerned only at the audit
stage when the expenditure has already taken place’4
. In this respect, the
CAG of India differs totally from the CAG of Britain who has powers of
both Comptroller as well as Auditor General. In other words, in Britain, the
executive can draw money from the public exchequer only with the
approval of the CAG.
CAG AND CORPORATIONS
The role of CAG in the auditing of public corporations is limited. Broadly
speaking, his relationship with the public corporations falls into the
following three categories:
(i) Some corporations are audited totally and directly by the CAG,
for example, Damodar Valley Corporation, Oil and Natural Gas
Commission, Air India, Indian Airlines Corporation, and others.
(ii) Some other corporations are audited by private professional
auditors who are appointed by the Central Government in
consultation with the CAG. If necessary, the CAG can conduct
supplementary audit. The examples are, Central Warehousing
Corporation, Industrial Finance Corporation, and others.
(iii) Some other corporations are totally subjected to private audit. In
other words, their audit is done exclusively by private
professional auditors and the CAG does not come into the picture
at all. They submit their annual reports and accounts directly to
the Parliament. Examples of such corporations are Life Insurance
Corporation of India, Reserve Bank of India, State Bank of India,
Food Corporation of India, and others.
The role of the CAG in the auditing of Government companies is also
limited. They are audited by private auditors who are appointed by the
Government on the advise of the CAG. The CAG can also undertake
supplementary audit or test audit of such companies.
In 1968, an Audit Board was established as a part of the office of CAG to
associate outside specialists and experts to handle the technical aspects of
audit of specialised enterprises like engineering, iron and steel, chemicals
and so on. This board was established on the recommendations of the
Administrative Reforms Commission of India. It consists of a Chairman
and two members appointed by the CAG.
APPLEBY’S CRITICISM
Paul H Appleby, in his two reports on Indian Administration, was very
critical of the role of CAG and attacked the significance of his work5
. He
also suggested that the CAG should be relieved of the responsibility of
audit. In other words, he recommended the abolition of the office of CAG.
His points of criticism of Indian audit are as follows:
1.  The function of the CAG in India, is in a large measure, an
inheritance from the colonial rule.
2.  The CAG is today a primary cause of widespread and paralysing
unwillingness to decide and to act. Auditing has a repressive and
negative influence.
3.  The Parliament has a greatly exaggerated notion of the importance
of auditing to Parliamentary responsibility, and so has failed to define
the functions of the CAG as the Constitution contemplated it would
do.
4.  The CAG’s function is not really a very important one. Auditors do
not know and cannot be expected to know very much about good
administration; their prestige is highest with others who do not know
much about administration.
5.  Auditors know what is auditing, which is not administration; it is a
necessary, but a highly pedestrian function with a narrow perspective
and a very limited usefulness.
6.  A deputy secretary in the department knows more about the
problems in his department than the CAG and his entire staff.

54 NITI Aayog
ESTABLISHMENT
On the 13th of August, 2014, the Modi Government scrapped the 65-yearold Planning Commission and announced that it would be replaced by a
new body. Accordingly, on January 1, 2015, the NITI Aayog (National
Institution for Transforming India) was established as the successor to the
planning commission.
However, it must be noted here that the NITI Aayog, like that of the
Planning Commission, was also created by an executive resolution1 of the
Government of India (i.e., Union Cabinet). Hence, it is also neither a
constitutional body nor a statutory body. In other words, it is a nonconstitutional or extra-constitutional body (i.e., not created by the
Constitution) and a non-statutory body (not created by an Act of the
Parliament).
NITI Aayog is the premier policy ‘Think Tank’ of the Government of
India, providing both directional and policy inputs. While designing
strategic and long-term policies and programmes for the Government of
India, NITI Aayog also provides relevant technical advice to the Centre and
States.
The centre-to-state one-way flow of policy, that was the hallmark of the
Planning Commission era, is now sought to be replaced by a genuine and
continuing partnership of states.
In a paradigmatic shift from the command and control approach of the
past, NITI Aayog accommodates diverse points of view in a collaborative,
rather than confrontationist, setting. In the spirit of federalism, NITI’s own
policy thinking too is shaped by a ‘bottom-up’ approach rather than a ‘topdown’ model.
RATIONALE
While explaining the reason for replacing the Planning Commission with
the NITI Aayog, the Union Government made the following observation:
“India has undergone a paradigm shift over the past six decades–politically,
economically, socially, technologically as well as demographically. The role
of Government in national development has seen a parallel evolution.
Keeping with these changing times, the Government of India has decided to
set up NITI Aayog (National Institution for Transforming India), in place of
the erstwhile Planning Commission, as a means to better serve the needs
and aspirations of the people of India.”2
The new institution will be a catalyst to the developmental process;
nurturing an overall enabling environment, through a holistic approach to
development going beyond the limited sphere of the Public Sector and
Government of India. This will be built on the foundations of:3
1.  An empowered role of States as equal partners in national
development; operationalising the principle of Cooperative
Federalism.
2.  A knowledge hub of internal as well as external resources; serving
as a repository of good governance best practices, and a Think Tank
offering domain knowledge as well as strategic expertise to all levels
of government.
3.  A collaborative platform facilitating implementation; by monitoring
progress, plugging gaps and bringing together the various ministries at
the Centre and in States, in the joint pursuit of developmental goals.
In the same context, the then Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said:
“The 65-year-old Planning Commission had become a redundant
organisation. It was relevant in a command economy structure, but not any
longer. India is a diversified country and its states are in various phases of
economic development along with their own strengths and weaknesses. In
this context, a ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach to economic planning is obsolete.
It cannot make India competitive in today’s global economy.”4
The Resolution observed: “Perhaps most importantly, the institution must
adhere to the tenet that while incorporating positive influences from the
world, no single model can be transplanted from outside into the Indian
scenario. We need to find our own strategy for growth. The new institution
has to zero in on what will work in and for India. It will be a Bharatiya
approach to development.”
COMPOSITION
The composition of the NITI Aayog is as follows:
(a)  Chairperson: The Prime Minister of India
(b)  Governing Council: It comprises the Chief Ministers of all the
States, Chief Ministers of Union Territories with Legislatures (i.e.,
Delhi, Puducherry and Jammu and Kashmir) and Lt. Governors of
other Union Territories.
(c)  Regional Councils: These are formed to address specific issues and
contingencies impacting more than one state or a region. These are
formed for a specified tenure. These are convened by the Prime
Minister and comprises of the Chief Ministers of States and Lt.
Governors of Union Territories in the region. These are chaired by the
Chairperson of the NITI Aayog or his nominee.
(d)  Special Invitees: Experts, specialists and practitioners with
relevant domain knowledge as special invitees nominated by the Prime
Minister.
(e)  Full-time Organisational Framework: It comprises, in addition to
the Prime Minister as the Chairperson:
(i) Vice-Chairperson: He is appointed by the Prime Minister. He
enjoys the rank of a Cabinet Minister.
(ii) Members: Full-time. They enjoy the rank of a Minister of
State.
(iii) Part-time Members: Maximum of 2, from leading
universities, research organisations and other relevant
institutions in an ex-officio capacity. Part-time members
would be on a rotation.
(iv) Ex-Officio Members: Maximum of 4 members of the Union
Council of Ministers to be nominated by the Prime Minister.
(v) Chief Executive Officer: He is appointed by the Prime
Minister for a fixed tenure, in the rank of Secretary to the
Government of India.
(vi) Secretariat: As deemed necessary.
SPECIALISED WINGS
NITI Aayog houses a number of specialised wings, including5
 :
1.  Research Wing: It develops in-house sectoral expertise as a
dedicated think tank of top notch domain experts, specialists and
scholars.
2.  Consultancy Wing: It provides a marketplace of whetted panels of
expertise and funding, for the Central and State Governments to tap
into matching their requirements with solution providers, public and
private, national and international. By playing match-maker instead of
providing the entire service itself, NITI Aayog is able to focus its
resources on priority matters, providing guidance and an overall
quality check to the rest.
3.  Team India Wing: It comprises of the representatives from every
State and Ministry and serves as a permanent platform for national
collaboration. Each representative:
(a)  Ensures that every State/Ministry has a continuous voice and stake
in the NITI Aayog.
(b)  Establishes a direct communication channel between the
State/Ministry and NITI Aayog for all development related matters, as
the dedicated liaison interface.
NITI Aayog functions in close cooperation, consultation and
coordination with the Ministries of the Central Government, and State
Governments. While it makes recommendations to the Central and State
Governments, the responsibility for taking and implementing decisions rests
with them.
OBJECTIVES
The objectives of the NITI Aayog are mentioned below:
1.  To evolve a shared vision of national development priorities,
sectors and strategies with the active involvement of States.
2.  To foster cooperative federalism through structured support
initiatives and mechanisms with the States on a continuous basis,
recognising that strong States make a strong nation.
3.  To develop mechanisms to formulate credible plans at the village
level and aggregate these progressively at higher levels of government.
4.  To ensure, on areas that are specifically referred to it, that the
interests of national security are incorporated in economic strategy and
policy.
5.  To pay special attention to the sections of our society that may be at
risk of not benefitting adequately from economic progress.
6.  To design strategic and long-term policy and programme
frameworks and initiatives, and monitor their progress and their
efficacy. The lessons learnt through monitoring and feedback will be
used for making innovative improvements, including necessary
midcourse corrections.
7.  To provide advice and encourage partnerships between key
stakeholders and national and international like-minded think tanks, as
well as educational and policy research institutions.
8.  To create a knowledge, innovation and entrepreneurial support
system through a collaborative community of national and
international experts, practitioners and other partners.
9.  To offer a platform for resolution of inter-sectoral and interdepartmental issues in order to accelerate the implementation of the
development agenda.
10.  To maintain a state-of-the-art Resource Centre, be a repository of
research on good governance and best practices in sustainable and
equitable development as well as help their dissemination to stakeholders.
11.  To actively monitor and evaluate the implementation of
programmes and initiatives, including the identification of the needed
resources so as to strengthen the probability of success and scope of
delivery.
12.  To focus on technology upgradation and capacity building for
implementation of programmes and initiatives.
13.  To undertake other activities as may be necessary in order to
further the execution of the national development agenda, and the
objectives mentioned above.
Through the above, the NITI Aayog aims to accomplish the following
objectives and opportunities:6
1.  An administration paradigm in which the Government is an
“enabler” rather than a “provider of first and last resort.”
2.  Progress from “food security” to focus on a mix of agricultural
production, as well as actual returns that farmers get from their
produce.
3.  Ensure that India is an active player in the debates and deliberations
on the global commons.
4.  Ensure that the economically vibrant middle-class remains engaged,
and its potential is fully realised.
5.  Leverage India’s pool of entrepreneurial, scientific and intellectual
human capital.
6.  Incorporate the significant geo-economic and geo-political strength
of the Non-Resident Indian Community.
7.  Use urbanisation as an opportunity to create a wholesome and
secure habitat through the use of modern technology.

in governance.
The NITI Aayog aims to enable India to better face complex challenges,
through the following:7
1.  Leveraging of India’s demographic dividend, and realisation of the
potential of youth, men and women, through education, skill
development, elimination of gender bias, and employment
2.  Elimination of poverty, and the chance for every Indian to live a life
of dignity and self-respect
3.  Redressal of inequalities based on gender bias, caste and economic
disparities
4.  Integrate villages institutionally into the development process
5.  Policy support to more than 50 million small businesses, which are
a major source of employment creation
6.  Safeguarding our environmental and ecological assets
FUNCTIONS
The various functions performed by the NITI Aayog can be divided into
four main heads:
1.  Design policy and programme framework.
2.  Foster co-operative federalism.
3.  Monitoring and evaluation.
4.  Think-tank, and Knowledge and Innovation Hub.
The NITI Aayog is functionally divided into various Verticals which are
responsible for examining and looking into sectoral issues and priorities for
national development and economic growth.
By dividing the entire gamut of activities in the NITI Aayog, the Team
India and Knowledge and Innovation Hubs were constituted, and
accordingly Verticals and Core Divisions were created. The two hubs are at
the core of NITI’s efficient functioning. The Team India Hub carries out the
mandate of fostering ‘Cooperative Federalism’ and ‘Designing Policy and
Programme Frameworks’. It provides requisite coordination and support
framework to NITI Aayog in its engagement with the States. On the other
hand, the Knowledge & Innovation Hub ensures fulfilling the mandate of
maintaining a State-of-the-Art Resource Centre; to be a repository of
research of good governance and best practices and their dissemination to
stakeholders; and to provide advice and encourage partnerships across key
areas.
The NITI Aayog uniquely focus thematic policy interventions which
encourages convergence across central ministries, state governments,
development partners, sector experts and professionals. This convergence
approach to governance is applied to achieve the objectives of NITI Aayog.
The different Verticals of NITI Aayog provide the requisite co-ordination
and support framework for NITI Aayog to carry out its mandate. The list of
Verticals is as follows:
1.  Agriculture
2.  Data Management & Analysis
3.  Energy
4.  Financial Resources
5.  Governance & Research
6.  Governing Council Secretariat
7.  Health
8.  Human Resource Development
9.  Industry
10.  Infrastructure Connectivity
11.  Land & Water Resources
12.  Managing Urbanisation
13.  Natural Resources & Environment
14.  NGO Darpan
15.  Project Appraisal & Management Division (PAMD)
16.  Public-Private Partnerships
17.  Rural Development
18.  Science & Technology
19.  Skill Development & Employment
20.  Social Justice & Empowerment
21.  State Coordination and Decentralized Planning
22.  Sustainable Development Goals
23.  Voluntary Action Cell
24.  Women & Child Development
GUIDING PRINCIPLES
In carrying out the above functions, the NITI Aayog is guided by the
following principles8
 :
1.  Antyodaya: Prioritise service and uplift of the poor, marginalised
and downtrodden, as enunciated in Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay’s idea
of ‘Antyodaya’.
2.  Inclusion: Empower vulnerable and marginalised sections,
redressing identitybased inequalities of all kinds–gender, region,
religion, caste or class.
3.  Village: Integrate our villages into the development process, to
draw on the vitality and energy of the bedrock of our ethos, culture and
sustenance.
4.  Demographic dividend: Harness our greatest asset, the people of
India; by focussing on their development, through education and
skilling, and their empowerment, through productive livelihood
opportunities.
5.  People’s Participation: Transform the developmental process into a
people-driven one, making an awakened and participative citizenry–
the driver of good governance.
6.  Governance: Nurture an open, transparent, accountable, pro-active
and purposeful style of governance, transitioning focus from Outlay to
Output to Outcome.
7.  Sustainability: Maintain sustainability at the core of our planning
and developmental process, building on our ancient tradition of respect
for the environment.
Therefore, the NITI Aayog is based on the following seven pillars of
effective governance:
(i) Pro-people agenda that fulfils the aspirations of the society as
well as individuals.
(ii) Pro-active in anticipating and responding to citizen needs.
(iii) Participative, by involvement of citizens.
(iv) Empowering women in all aspects.
(v) Inclusion of all groups with special attention to the SCs, STs,
OBCs and minorities.
(vi) Equality of opportunity for the youth.
(vii) Transparency through the use of technology to make government
visible and responsive.
Through its commitment to a cooperative federalism, promotion of
citizen engagement, egalitarian access to opportunity, participative and
adaptive governance and increasing use of technology, the NITI Aayog
seeks to provide a critical directional and strategic input into the
development process. This, along with being the incubator of ideas for
development, is the core mission of NITI Aayog.
COOPERATIVE FEDERALISM
The NITI Aayog has been constituted to actualize the important goal of
cooperative federalism and to enable good governance in India, to build
strong states that will make a strong nation. In a truly federal state, several
objectives that ought to be achieved may carry political ramifications
throughout the country. It is impossible for any federal government to
achieve the national objectives without active cooperation from state
governments. It is, therefore, crucial that the Centre and State governments
work together as equals8a
.
The two key features or aspects of Cooperative Federalism are:
(i) Joint focus on the National Development Agenda by the
Centre and the States; and
(ii) Advocacy of State perspectives with Central Ministries8b
.
In keeping with this, the NITI Aayog has been mandated the task of
evolving a shared vision of national development priorities, sectors and
strategies with the active involvement of States. These priorities ought to
reflect the national objectives and foster cooperative federalism through
structured support to States on a continuous basis. The NITI Aayog ought
also to help states develop mechanisms to formulate credible plans at the
village level and aggregate these progressively at higher levels of
government. The aim is to progress from a stage when the Centre decided
development policies to a truly federal government wherein States are equal
stakeholders in the planning process8c
.
The policy of the Government to involve State governments is reflected
in changes in the interaction processes of the NITI Aayog. Consistent with
its mandate, the NITI Aayog has undertaken several crucial initiatives to
ensure that States are equal partners in the policy making and implementing
process8d
.
At the meetings of the Governing Council of NITI Aayog, the Prime
Minister highlighted the importance of NITI Aayog as a platform to inspite
cooperative federalism, stressing on the need for effective center-state
cooperation to advance development outcomes and achieve double-digit
and inclusive growth for India.
It is the constant endeavor of NITI Aayog to evolve a shared vision of
national priorities, sectors, and strategies with the active involvement of
States, wherein States are equal stakeholders in the planning process as
well. In keeping with this, the Vice-Chairman of NITI Aayog committed
himself to visit all States, to develop and offer a platform for resolution of
inter-sectoral and inter-departmental issues in order to accelerate the
implementation of the development agenda.
The NITI Aayog has also established models and programmes for
development of infrastructure and to reignite and establish Private-Public
Partnership, such as the Centre-State partnership model: Development
Support Services to States (DSSS); and the Sustainable Action For
Transforming Human Capital (SATH) programme which is designed to help
States improve their social sector indicators by providing them technical
support.
Further, with the aim of correcting regional development imbalance, the
NITI Aayog has taken special steps for regions needing special attention
and support, like the North Eastern States, Island States and hilly
Himayalan States by constituting special forums to identify their specific
constraints, formulating special policies to ensure sustainable development
takes place in these regions while also protecting their abundant natural
resources.
From the above discussion, we can summarise the various manifestions
of Cooperative Federalism in the working of the NITI Aayog:
1.  Meetings of Governing Council
2.  Sub-groups of Chief Ministers on different subjects
3.  Task Forces on specific subjects
4.  NITI Forum for North East
5.  Sustainable Development in the Indian Himayalan Region
6.  Development Support Services to States
7.  Sustainable Action For Transforming Human Capital (SATH)
CRITICISM
Hitting out at the government for its decision to restructure the Planning
Commission and rechristen it as “NITI Aayog”, the Opposition said the
move is just a “fluff” and mere “gimmickry”. They also expressed their
apprehension that the new body will pave the way for discrimination, as
“corporates will call the shots” in policy-making in the country.
CPI(M) leader Sitaram Yechury termed the renaming of the Planning
Commission as aniti aur durniti (no policy and bad policy).
Mr. Yechury said, “just a change of nomenclature and gimmickry does
not serve any purpose. Let us see what the government plans to do with it”.
“If the government wants to greet people with fluff and not substance on
the first day of 2015, then there is nothing more that can be said... If the
North Block or the Finance Ministry has a very short-term view of both
fiscal and monetary objective and is going to be the final arbiter between
the states and the Centre... it being the stakeholder in the process... I am
afraid, is going to discriminate against the states,” Congress leader Manish
Tewari said.
“After all, what was the Planning Commission doing? It used to plan
policy. So by changing the nomenclature from Planning Commission to
NITI Aayog what is the message this government is trying to send,” Mr.
Tewari said, adding that Congress’ opposition to restructuring of the
Planning Commission was based on “principles”.
“It’s not a question of fighting a war, it’s a matter of principle. The
Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party used to go extra lengths talking about
federalism and how the sanctity and sacrosanct of federalism has to be
maintained. And now they are going exactly the reverse,” the Congress
leader said.
Veteran CPI leader Gurudas Dasgupta said that dismantling of the
Planning Commission and bringing in a new body in its place will lead to
an unregulated economy. “It is not a change of name. The Planning
Commission is being abolished because they (government) don’t believe in
planning,” he said.
“The government would like to have a fullmarket economy (which is)
totally unregulated,” Mr. Dasgupta said adding. “If this becomes the policy
of the government to not help advance the country, control inflation and
create job opportunities, it will not be good for the country”.9
“Mere change of name from Yojana Aayog to NITI is not objectionable if
it is coupled with real reform. Otherwise, it will be purely cosmetic like
earlier naming ceremonies,” Congress spokesperson Abhishek Manu
Singhvi said. He said the Congress would have supported constructive
reform of the Planning Commission. But the “alteration of identity and
basic structure”, he said, “is being done because of anti-Nehruvianism and
anti-Congression.”10
CPI(M) central committee member Md Selim, MP, said no meaningful
purpose would be served by just renaming the Planning Commission.
Alleging that the BJP government had decided to dissolve the planning
commission “to dilute the planning process”, he said the government should
have given more teeth to the National Development Council instead.11
ATTACHED OFFICES
There are two offices attached to the NITI Aayog. They are explained
below:
1. National Institute of Labour Economics Research and Development
The National Institute of Labour Economics Research and Development
(NILERD) was formerly known as the Institute of Applied Manpower
Research (IAMR). It is a central autonomous organization attached to the
NITI Aayog. Its primary objectives are research, data collection, education
and training in all aspects of human capital planning, human resource
development, and monitoring and evaluation.
The IAMR was established in 1962 under the Societies Registration Act
of 1860 as an institution that would function as a clearinghouse of ideas and
undertake policy research on human capital development to inform
perspective planning and promote policy integration. The main object of the
Institute is to advance knowledge about the nature, characteristics and
utilisation of human resources through research, education and training,
consultancy, etc.
The IAMR has been renamed as NILERD in 2014. The NILERD is
mainly funded by grants-in-aid from the NITI Aayog (formerly Planning
Commission), and supplemented by its own revenue from contracted
research projects, and education and training activities. The prime objective
of NILERD has been to develop an institutional framework capable of
sustaining and steering a systematic applied human resource planning
research process.
Since its inception, the Institute has carved out its own trajectory to
achieve academic heights, and in the process, developed a range of
academic activities not only in the field of human resource planning and
development, but also in monitoring and evaluation of public policies and
programmes. During the past few years, the Institute has exhibited
remarkable dynamism in addressing the issues of national priorities. The
Institute has emerged as a pioneering institute in providing academic
training on human resource planning and development for both
international and national participants.
The Institute moved to its own campus at Narela in 2002. Narela is a
developing urban and institutional hub declared as a special economic zone
for knowledge in the National Capital Region.
2. Development Monitoring and Evaluation Office:
The need for an efficient and independent evaluation mechanism in India
was recognized by the planners and policy-makers right from the
introduction of planning process in the country and resultantly, the
Programme Evaluation Organization was established by the Government in
1952 to carry out independent and objective impact evaluation of the
Central Government funded programmes.
The Development Monitoring and Evaluation Office (DMEO) was
established by the Government in 2015 as an attached office of the NITI
Aayog by merging the erstwhile Programme Evaluation Organization and
the Independent Evaluation Office. The DMEO is headed by the Director
General who is equivalent to an Additional Secretary to the Government of
India. To ensure that DMEO is able to function independently and
effectively, it has been provided with separate budgetary allocations and
manpower in addition to complete functional autonomy.
The DMEO has been mandated to actively monitor and evaluate the
implementation of the programmes and initiatives of the Government of
India, including the identification of the needed resources so as to
strengthen the probability of the success and scope of delivery.
The functions of DMEO are:
1.  Monitor the implementation of Government programmes
2.  Help Ministries in designing TORs for evaluation studies
3.  Monitor the implementation and progress of SDGs
4.  Promote the spirit of Cooperative Federalism
5.  Conduct evaluation of the Government programmes
At the NITI Aayog level, the programme evaluation work is being looked
after under the overall guidance of the Vice-Chairman, NITI Aayog. In
addition to the Director General, the DMEO has been provided with 4
Deputy Director Generals (SAG level) to look after the functional mandate
in addition to the Joint Secretary (Adm. & Fin.) who is to provide
administrative and logistics support. The Headquarter of DMEO is in NITI
Aayog, New Delhi.
The DMEO had 15 Regional Offices known as Regional Development
Monitoring and Evaluation Offices (RDMEOs). Each RDMEO was headed
by a Director level officer. The RDMEOs conducted field surveys and data/
information collection work for evaluation studies, and they also played an
important role in promoting cooperative federalism by their interaction with
the States and UT administrations. However, keeping in view the changed
functional requirements, they were closed in 2017 and the staff were
transferred to DMEO Hqrs in New Delhi.
ERSTWHILE PLANNING COMMISSION
The erstwhile Planning Commission was established in March 1950 by an
executive resolution of the Government of India, (i.e., the Union Cabinet)
on the recommendation of the Advisory Planning Board constituted in
1946, under the chairmanship of K.C. Neogi. Thus, the erstwhile
Planning Commission was neither a constitutional body nor a statutory
body. In India, it was the supreme organ of planning for social and
economic development.
Functions
The functions of the erstwhile Planning Commission included the
following:
1.  To make an assessment of material, capital and human resources of
the country, and investigate the possibilities of augmenting them.
2.  To formulate a plan for the most effective and balanced utilisation
of the country’s resources.
3.  To determine priorities and to define the stages in which the plan
should be carried out.
4.  To indicate the factors that retard economic development.
5.  To determine the nature of the machinery required for successful
implementation of the plan in each stage.
6.  To appraise, from time to time, the progress achieved in execution
of the plan and to recommend necessary adjustments.
7.  To make appropriate recommendations for facilitating the discharge
of its duties, or on a matter referred to it for advice by Central or state
governments.
The Allocation of Business Rules had assigned the following matters (in
addition to the above) to the erstwhile Planning Commission:
1.  Public Co-operation in National Development
2.  Specific programmes for area development notified from time to
time
3.  Perspective Planning
4.  Institute of Applied Manpower Research
5.  Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI)
6.  All matters relating to National Rainfed Area Authority (NRAA)
Earlier, the National Informatics Centre was also under the erstwhile
Planning Commission. Later, it was brought under the Ministry of
Information Technology.
It should be noted that the erstwhile Planning Commission was only a
staff agency–an advisory body and had no executive responsibility. It was
not responsible for taking and implementing decisions. This responsibility
rested with the Central and State Governments.
Composition
The following points can be noted in context of the composition
(membership) of the erstwhile Planning Commission:
1.  The Prime Minister of India was the chairman of the commission.
He presided over the meetings of the commission.
2.  The commission had a deputy chairman. He was the de facto
executive head (i.e., full-time functional head) of the commission. He
was responsible for the formulation and submission of the draft of
Five-Year Plan to the Central cabinet. He was appointed by the Central
cabinet for a fixed tenure and enjoyed the rank of a Cabinet Minister.
Though he was not a member of cabinet, he was invited to attend all its
meetings (without a right to vote).
3.  Some Central Ministers were appointed as part-time members of
the commission. In any case, the finance minister and planning
minister were the exofficio (by virtue of) members of the commission.
4.  The commission had four to seven fulltime expert members. They
enjoyed the rank of a minister of state.
5.  The commission had a member-secretary. He was usually a senior
member of IAS. The state governments were not represented in the
commission in any way. Thus, the erstwhile Planning Commission was
wholly a Centre-constituted body.
Critical Evaluation
The erstwhile Planning Commission was originally established as a staff
agency with advisory role but in the course of time it had emerged as a
powerful and directive authority whereby its recommendations were
considered both by the Union and states. The critics had described it as a
‘Super Cabinet’, an ‘Economic Cabinet’, a ‘Parallel Cabinet’, the ‘Fifth
Wheel of the Coach’ and so on.
The following observations were made on the domineering role played
by the erstwhile Planning Commission.
1.  Administrative Reforms Commission (ARC) of India: The ARC
observed: ‘Under the Constitution, the ministers, whether in the Centre
or the states, are in effect, the ultimate executive authorities.
Unfortunately, the Planning Commission has, in some measures,
earned the reputation of being a Parallel Cabinet and sometimes, a
Super Cabinet’.12
2.  K. Santhanam This eminent constitutional expert stated that,
‘Planning has superseded the federation and our country is functioning
like a unitary system in many respects.13
3.  P.V. Rajamannar Rajamannar, the Chairman of the Fourth Finance
Commission, highlighted the overlapping of functions and
responsibilities between the erstwhile Planning Commission and
Finance Commission in federal fiscal transfers.14
NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL
On the 1st of January, 2016, it was reported15
that the Modi government is
also going to abolish the National Development Council (NDC) and
transfer its powers to the Governing Council of the NITI Aayog. However,
till now (October 2019), such a resolution has not been passed.
It must also be noted here that the last meeting (57th
) of the NDC was
held on the 27th of December, 2012 to approve the 12thPlan (2012–2017).
The National Development Council (NDC) was established in August
1952 by an executive resolution of the Government of India on the
recommendation of the First Five Year Plan (draft outline). Like the
erstwhile Planning Commission, it is neither a constitutional body nor a
statutory body.
16
Composition
The NDC is composed of the following members.
1.  The Prime Minister of India (as its chairman/head).
2.  All Union Cabinet Ministers (since 1967).17
3.  The Chief Ministers of all the states.
4.  The Chief Ministers/administrators of all union territories.
5.  Members of the Planning Commission (now NITI Aayog).
The secretary of the Planning Commission (now NITI Aayog) acts as the
secretary to the NDC. It (NDC) is also provided with administrative and
other assistance for its work by the Planning Commission (now NITI
Aayog).
Objectives
The NDC was established with the following objectives.
1.  To secure cooperation of states in the execution of the Plan.
2.  To strengthen and mobilise the efforts and resources of the nation in
support of the Plan.
3.  To promote common economic policies in all vital spheres.
4.  To ensure balanced and rapid development of all parts of the
country.
Functions
To realise the above objectives, the NDC is assigned with the following
functions:
1.  To prescribe guidelines for preparation of the national Plan.
2.  To consider the national Plan as prepared by the Planning
Commission (now NITI Aayog).
3.  To make an assessment of the resources required for implementing
the Plan and to suggest measures for augmenting them.
4.  To consider important questions of social and economic policy
affecting national development.
5.  To review the working of the national Plan from time to time.
6.  To recommend measures for achievement of the aims and targets
set out in the national Plan.
The Draft Five-Year Plan prepared by the Planning Commission (now
NITI Aayog) is first submitted to the Union Cabinet. After its approval, it is
placed before the NDC, for its acceptance. Then, the Plan is presented to
the Parliament. With its approval, it emerges as the official Plan and
published in the official gazette.
Therefore, the NDC is the highest body, below the Parliament,
responsible for policy matters with regard to planning for social and
economic development. However, it is listed as an advisory body to the
Planning Commission (now NITI Aayog) and its recommendations are not
binding. It makes its recommendations to the Central and state governments
and should meet at least twice every year.
Critical Evaluation The first and foremost function of NDC is to act as a
bridge and link between the Central Government, the State Governments
and the Planning Commission (now NITI Aayog) especially in the field of
planning, to bring about coordination of policies and programmes of plans.
It has been, to a large extent successful in this regard. Besides, it has also
served as a forum for Centre-State deliberations on matters of national
importance, and also as a device for sharing responsibility between them in
the federal political system.
However, two diametrically opposite views have been expressed on its
working. On one hand, it has been described as a ‘Super Cabinet’ due to its
wide and powerful composition, though its recommendations are only
advisory and not binding, and can hardly be ignored as they are backed by a
national mandate. On the other hand, it has been described as a mere
‘rubber stamp’ of the policy decisions already taken by the Union
government. This is mainly due to the Congress Party rule both at the
Centre and states for a long period. However, due to the emergence of
regional parties in various states, the NDC is steadily acquiring its federal
character and thus providing a greater say to the states in the preparation of
national plans.

55 National Human Rights
Commission
ESTABLISHMENT OF THE COMMISSION
The National Human Rights Commission is a statutory (and not a
constitutional) body. It was established in 1993 under a legislation enacted
by the Parliament, namely, the Protection of Human Rights Act, 19931
 .
The commission is the watchdog of human rights in the country, that is,
the rights relating to life, liberty, equality and dignity of the individual
guaranteed by the Constitution or embodied in the international covenants2
and enforceable by courts in India.
The specific objectives of the establishment of the commission are3
 :
(a)  To strengthen the institutional arrangements through which human
rights issues could be addressed in their entirety in a more focussed
manner;
(b)  To look into allegations of excesses, independently of the
government, in a manner that would underline the government’s
commitment to protect human rights; and
(c)  To complement and strengthen the efforts that have already been
made in this direction.
COMPOSITION OF THE COMMISSION
The commission is a multi-member body consisting of a chairperson and
five members. The chairperson should be a retired chief justice of India or a
judge of the Supreme Court and members should be a serving or retired
judge of the Supreme Court, a serving or retired chief justice of a high court
and three persons (out of which atleast one should be a woman) having
knowledge or practical experience with respect to human rights. In addition
to these full-time members, the commission also has seven ex-officio
members–the chairpersons of the National Commission for Minorities, the
National Commission for SCs, the National Commission for STs, the
National Commission for Women, the National Commission for BCs and
the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights and the Chief
Commissioner for Persons with Disabilities.
The chairperson and members are appointed by the president on the
recommendations of a six-member committee consisting of the prime
minister as its head, the Speaker of the Lok Sabha, the Deputy Chairman of
the Rajya Sabha, leaders of the Opposition in both the Houses of Parliament
and the Central home minister. Further, a sitting judge of the Supreme Court
or a sitting chief justice of a high court can be appointed only after
consultation with the chief justice of India.
The chairperson and members hold office for a term of three years or
until they attain the age of 70 years, whichever is earlier. They are elligible
for re-appointment. After their tenure, the chairperson and members are not
eligible for further employment under the Central or a state government.
The president can remove the chairperson or any member from the office
under the following circumstances:
(a)  If he is adjudged an insolvent; or
(b)  If he engages, during his term of office, in any paid employment
outside the duties of his office; or
(c)  If he is unfit to continue in office by reason of infirmity of mind or
body; or
(d)  If he is of unsound mind and stand so declared by a competent
court; or
(e)  If he is convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for an offence.
In addition to these, the president can also remove the chairperson or any
member on the ground of proved misbehaviour or incapacity. However, in
these cases, the president has to refer the matter to the Supreme Court for an
inquiry. If the Supreme Court, after the inquiry, upholds the cause of
removal and advises so, then the president can remove the chairperson or a
member.
The salaries, allowances and other conditions of service of the
chairperson or a member are determined by the Central government. But,
they cannot be varied to his disadvantage after his appointment.
All the above provisions are aimed at securing autonomy, independence
and impartiality in the functioning of the Commission.
FUNCTIONS OF THE COMMISSION
The functions of the Commission are:
(a)  To inquire into any violation of human rights or negligence in the
prevention of such violation by a public servant, either suo motu or on
a petition presented to it or on an order of a court.
(b)  To intervene in any proceeding involving allegation of violation of
human rights pending before a court.
(c)  To visit jails and detention places to study the living conditions of
inmates and make recommendation thereon.
(d)  To review the constitutional and other legal safeguards for the
protection of human rights and recommend measures for their effective
implementation.
(e)  To review the factors including acts of terrorism that inhibit the
enjoyment of human rights and recommend remedial measures.
(f)  To study treaties and other international instruments on human
rights and make recommendations for their effective implementation.
(g)  To undertake and promote research in the field of human rights.
(h)  To spread human rights literacy among the people and promote
awareness of the safeguards available for the protection of these rights.
(i)  To encourage the efforts of nongovernmental organisations (NGOs)
working in the field of human rights.
(j)  To undertake such other functions as it may consider necessary for
the promotion of human rights.
WORKING OF THE COMMISSION
The commission’s headquarters is at Delhi and it can also establish offices
at other places in India. It is vested with the power to regulate its own
procedure. It has all the powers of a civil court and its proceedings have a
judicial character. It may call for information or report from the Central and
state governments or any other authority subordinate thereto.
The commission has its own nucleus of investigating staff for
investigation into complaints of human rights violations. Besides, it is
empowered to utilise the services of any officer or investigation agency of
the Central government or any state government for the purpose. It has also
established effective cooperation with the NGOs with first-hand
information about human rights violations.
The commission is not empowered to inquire into any matter after the
expiry of one year from the date on which the act constituting violation of
human rights is alleged to have been committed. In other words, it can look
into a matter within one year of its occurrence4
 .
The commission may take any of the following steps during or upon the
completion of an inquiry:
(a)  it may recommend to the concerned government or authority to
make payment of compensation or damages to the victim;
(b)  it may recommend to the concerned government or authority the
initiation of proceedings for prosecution or any other action against the
guilty public servant;
(c)  it may recommend to the concerned government or authority for
the grant of immediate interim relief to the victim;
(d)  it may approach the Supreme Court or the high court concerned
for the necessary directions, orders or writs.
ROLE OF THE COMMISSION
From the above, it is clear that the functions of the commission are mainly
recommendatory in nature. It has no power to punish the violators of human
rights, nor to award any relief including monetary relief to the victim.
Notably, its recommendations are not binding on the concerned government
or authority. But, it should be informed about the action taken on its
recommendations within one month. In this context, a former member of
the Commission observed5
: ‘The government cannot wash away the
recommendations made by the Commission. The commission’s role may be
recommendatory, advisory, yet the Government considers the cases
forwarded by it. It is, therefore, improper to say that the commission is
powerless. It enjoys great material authority and no government can ignore
its recommendation’.
Moreover, the commission has limited role, powers and jurisdiction with
respect to the violation of human rights by the members of the armed
forces6
. In this sphere, the commission may seek a report from the Central
government and make its recommendations. The Central government
should inform the Commission of the action taken on the recommendations
within three months.
The commission submits its annual or special reports to the Central
government and to the state government concerned. These reports are laid
before the respective legislatures, along with a memorandum of action
taken on the recommendations of the commission and the reasons for nonacceptance of any of such recommendations.

56 State Human Rights Commission
The Protection of Human Rights Act of 1993 provides for the creation of
not only the National Human Rights Commission but also a State Human
Rights Commission at the state level1
. Accordingly, twenty six states have
constituted the State Human Rights Commissions through Official Gazette
Notifications2
 .
A State Human Rights Commission can inquire into violation of human
rights only in respect of subjects mentioned in the State List (List-II) and
the Concurrent List (List-III) of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution.
However, if any such case is already being inquired into by the National
Human Rights Commission or any other Statutory Commission, then the
State Human Rights Commission does not inquire into that case.
The central government may confer upon the State Human Rights
Commissions the functions relating to human rights being discharged by the
union territories, except the union territory of Delhi. The functions relating
to human rights in case of union territory of Delhi are to be dealt with by
the National Human Rights Commission.
COMPOSITION OF THE COMMISSION
The State Human Rights Commission is a multi-member body consisting of
a chairperson and two members3
. The chairperson should be a retired Chief
Justice or a Judge of a High Court and members should be a serving or
retired judge of a High Court or a District Judge in the state with a
minimum of seven years experience as District Judge and a person having
knowledge or practical experience with respect to human rights.
The chairperson and members are appointed by the Governor on the
recommendations of a committee consisting of the chief minister as its
head, the speaker of the Legislative Assembly, the state home minister and
the leader of the opposition in the Legislative Assembly. In the case of a
state having Legislative Council, the chairman of the Council and the leader
of the opposition in the Council would also be the members of the
committee. Further, a sitting judge of a High Court or a sitting District
Judge can be appointed only after consultation with the Chief Justice of the
High Court of the concerned state.
The chairperson and members hold office for a term of three years or
until they attain the age of 70 years, whichever is earlier. They are elligible
for re-appointment. After their tenure, the chairperson and members are not
eligible for further employment under a state government or the Central
government.
Although the chairperson and members of a State Human Rights
Commission are appointed by the governor, they can be removed only by
the President (and not by the governor). The President can remove them on
the same grounds and in the same manner as he can remove the chairperson
or a member of the National Human Rights Commission. Thus, he can
remove the chairperson or a member under the following circumstances:
(a)  If he is adjudged an insolvent; or
(b)  If he engages, during his term of office, in any paid employment
outside the duties of his office; or
(c)  If he is unfit to continue in office by reason of infirmity of mind or
body; or
(d)  If he is of unsound mind and stands so declared by a competent
court; or
(e)  If he is convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for an offence.
In addition to these, the president can also remove the chairperson or a
member on the ground of proved misbehaviour or incapacity. However, in
these cases, the President has to refer the matter to the Supreme Court for
an inquiry. If the Supreme Court, after the inquiry, upholds the cause of
removal and advises so, then the President can remove the chairperson or a
member.
The salaries, allowances and other conditions of service of the
chairperson or a member are determined by the state government. But, they
cannot be varied to his disadvantage after his appointment.
All the above provisions are aimed at securing autonomy, independence
and impartiality in the functioning of the Commission.
FUNCTIONS OF THE COMMISSION
The functions of the Commission are:
(a)  To inquire into any violation of human rights or negligence in the
prevention of such violation by a public servant, either suo motu or on
a petition presented to it or on an order of a court.
(b)  To intervene in any proceeding involving allegation of violation of
human rights pending before a court.
(c)  To visit jails and detention places to study the living conditions of
inmates and make recommendation thereon.
(d)  To review the constitutional and other legal safeguards for the
protection of human rights and recommend measures for their effective
implementation.
(e)  To review the factors including acts of terrorism that inhibit the
enjoyment of human rights and recommend remedial measures.
(f)  To undertake and promote research in the field of human rights.
(g)  To spread human rights literacy among the people and promote
awareness of the safeguards available for the protection of these rights.
(h)  To encourage the efforts of non-governmental organizations
(NGOs) working in the field of human rights.
(i)  To undertake such other functions as it may consider necessary for
the promotion of human rights.
WORKING OF THE COMMISSION
The Commission is vested with the power to regulate its own procedure. It
has all the powers of a civil court and its proceedings have a judicial
character. It may call for information or report from the state government or
any other authority subordinate thereto.
The Commission is not empowered to inquire into any matter after the
expiry of one year from the date on which the act constituting violation of
human rights is alleged to have been committed. In other words, it can look
into a matter within one year of its occurrence.
The Commission may take any of the following steps during or upon the
completion of an inquiry:
(a)  it may recommend to the state government or authority to make
payment of compensation or damages to the victim;
(b)  it may recommend to the state government or authority the
initiation of proceedings for prosecution or any other action against the
guilty public servant;
(c)  it may recommend to the state government or authority for the
grant of immediate interim relief to the victim;
(d)  it may approach the Supreme Court or the state high court for the
necessary directions, orders or writs.
From the above, it is clear that the functions of the commission are
mainly recommendatory in nature. It has no power to punish the violators of
human rights, nor to award any relief including monetary relief to the
victim. Notably, its recommendations are not binding on the state
government or authority. But, it should be informed about the action taken
on its recommendations within one month.
The Commission submits its annual or special reports to the state
government. These reports are laid before the state legislature, along with a
memorandum of action taken on the recommendations of the Commission
and the reasons for non-acceptance of any of such recommendations4
 .
HUMAN RIGHTS COURTS
The Protection of Human Rights Act (1993) also provides for the
establishment of Human Rights Court in every district for the speedy trial
of violation of human rights.
These courts can be set up by the state government only with the
concurrence of the Chief Justice of the High Court of that state.
For every Human Rights Court, the state government specifies a public
prosecutor or appoints an advocate (who has practiced for seven years) as a
special public prosecutor.
2019 AMENDMENT ACT
The various provisions or features of the Protection of Human Rights
(Amendment) Act, 2019, are as follows:

57 Central Information Commission
The Central Information Commission was established by the Central
Government in 2005. It was constituted through an Official Gazette
Notification under the provisions of the Right to Information Act (2005).

appeals pertaining to offices, financial institutions, public sector
undertakings, etc., under the Central Government and the Union Territories.

Commissioner1
. They are appointed by the President on the
recommendation of a committee consisting of the Prime Minister as
Chairperson, the Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha and a Union
Cabinet Minister nominated by the Prime Minister2
. They should be persons
of eminence in public life with wide knowledge and experience in law,
science and technology, social service, management, journalism, mass
media or administration and governance. They should not be a Member of

Information Commissioner from the office under the following
circumstances:
(a)  if he is adjudged an insolvent; or
(b)  if he has been convicted of an offence which (in the opinion of the
President) involves a moral turpitude; or
(c)  if he engages during his term of office in any paid employment
outside the duties of his office; or
(d)  if he is (in the opinion of the President) unfit to continue in office
due to infirmity of mind or body; or
(e)  if he has acquired such financial or other interest as is likely to
affect prejudicially his official functions.
In addition to these, the President can also remove the Chief Information
Commissioner or any Information Commissioner on the ground of proved
misbehaviour or incapac-ity4
. However, in these cases, the President has to
refer the matter to the Supreme Court for an enquiry. If the Supreme Court,
after the enquiry, upholds the cause of removal and advises so, then the

58 State Information Commission
The Right to Information Act of 2005 provides for the creation of not only
the Central Information Commission but also a State Information
Commission at the state level. Accordingly, all the states have constituted
the State Information Commissions through Official Gazette Notifications.
The State Information Commission is a high-powered independent body
which interalia looks into the complaints made to it and decide the appeals.
It entertains complaints and appeals pertaining to offices, financial
institutions, public sector undertakings, etc., under the concerned state
government.
COMPOSITION
The Commission consists of a State Chief Information Commissioner and
not more than ten State Information Commissioners1
. They are appointed by
the Governor on the recommendation of a committee consisting of the
Chief Minister as Chairperson, the Leader of Opposition in the Legislative
Assembly and a State Cabinet Minister nominated by the Chief Minister2
.
They should be persons of eminence in public life with wide knowledge
and experience in law, science and technology, social service, management,
journalism, mass media or administration and governance. They should not
be a Member of Parliament or Member of the Legislature of any State or
Union Territory. They should not hold any other office of profit or
connected with any political party or carrying on any business or pursuing
any profession.
TENURE AND SERVICE CONDITIONS

59 Central Vigilance Commission
ESTABLISHMENT
The Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) is the main agency for
preventing corruption in the Central government. It was established in 1964
by an executive resolution of the Central government. Its establishment was
recommended by the Santhanam Committee on Prevention of Corruption1
(1962–64).
Thus, originally the CVC was neither a constitutional body nor a
statutory body. Later, in 2003, the Parliament enacted a law conferring
statutory status on the CVC2
 .
In 2004, the CVC has been designated as the agency to receive and act on
complaints or disclosure on any allegation of corruption or misuse of office
from whistle blowers under the “Public Interest Disclosure and Protection
of Informers’ Resolution” (PIDPI), which is popularly known as “Whistle
Blowers” Resolution. The Commission is also empowered as the only
designated agency to take action against complainants making motivated or
vexatious complaints.2a
The CVC is conceived to be the apex vigilance institution, free of control
from any executive authority, monitoring all vigilance activity under the
Central Government and advising various authorities in Central
Government organisations in planning, executing, reviewing and reforming
their vigilance work.
COMPOSITION
The CVC is a multi-member body consisting of a Central Vigilance
Commissioner (chairperson) and not more than two vigilance
commissioners. They are appointed by the president by warrant under his
hand and seal on the recommendation of a three-member committee
consisting of the prime minister as its head, the Union minister of home
affairs and the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha. They hold office
for a term of four years or until they attain the age of sixty five years,
whichever is earlier. After their tenure, they are not eligible for further
employment under the Central or a state government.
The president can remove the Central Vigilance Commissioner or any
vigilance commissioner from the office under the following circumstances:
(a)  If he is adjudged an insolvent; or
(b)  If he has been convicted of an offence which (in the opinion of the
Central government) involves a moral turpitude; or
(c)  If he engages, during his term of office, in any paid employment
outside the duties of his office; or
(d)  If he is (in the opinion of the president), unfit to continue in office
by reason of infirmity of mind or body; or
(e)  If he has acquired such financial or other interest as is likely to
affect prejudicially his official functions.
In addition to these, the president can also remove the Central Vigilance
Commissioner or any vigilance commissioner on the ground of proved
misbehaviour or incapacity. However, in these cases, the president has to
refer the matter to the Supreme Court for an enquiry. If the Supreme Court,
after the enquiry, upholds the cause of removal and advises so, then the
president can remove him. He is deemed to be guilty of misbehaviour, if he
(a) is concerned or interested in any contract or agreement made by the
Central government, or (b) participates in any way in the profit of such
contract or agreement or in any benefit or emolument arising therefrom
otherwise than as a member and in common with the other members of an
incorporated company.
The salary, allowances and other conditions of service of the Central
Vigilance Commissioner are similar to those of the Chairman of UPSC and
that of the vigilance commissioner are similar to those of a member of
UPSC. But they cannot be varied to his disadvantage after his appointment.
ORGANISATION
The CVC has its own Secretariat, Chief Technical Examiners’ Wing (CTE)

WHISTLE BLOWERS PROTECTION ACT (2014)
The salient features of the Whistle Blowers Protection Act (2014)6 are as
follows7
 :
1.  The Act provides a mechanism for protecting the identity of whistle
blowers (a term given to people who expose corruption). People who
expose corruption in Government or irregularities by public
functionaries can now be free of any fear of victimization.
2.  The Act also provides for a system to encourage people to disclose
information about corruption or the wilful misuse of power by public
servants, including ministers.
3.  As per the Act, a person can make a public interest disclosure on
corruption before a competent authority - which is at present the
Central Vigilance Commission (CVC). The government, by
notification, can appoint any other body also for receiving such
complaints about corruption.
4.  The Act, however, lays down punishment of up to two years in
prison and a fine of up to ₹30,000 for false or frivolous complaints.
5.  The Act says that every disclosure shall be made in good faith and
the person making the disclosure shall provide a personal declaration
stating that he reasonably believes that the information disclosed by
him and the allegation contained therein is substantially true.
6.  Disclosures can be made in writing or by email message in
accordance with the procedure as may be prescribed and contain full
particulars and be accompanied by supporting documents, or other
material.
7.  However, no action shall be taken on a disclosure if it does not
indicate the identity of the complainant or public servant or if “the
identity of the complainant or public servant is found to be incorrect.”
8.  The Act is not applicable to the Special Protection Group.

60 Central Bureau of Investigation
ESTABLISHMENT OF CBI
The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) was set up in 1963 by a
resolution of the Ministry of Home Affairs. Later, it was transferred to the
Ministry of Personnel and now it enjoys the status of an attached office1
.
The Special Police Establishment (which looked into vigilance cases) setup
in 1941 was also merged with the CBI.
The establishment of the CBI was recommended by the Santhanam
Committee on Prevention of Corruption (1962–1964). The CBI is not a
statutory body. It derives its powers from the Delhi Special Police
Establishment Act, 1946.
The CBI is the main investigating agency of the Central Government. It
plays an important role in the prevention of corruption and maintaining
integrity in administration. It also provides assistance to the Central
Vigilance Commission and Lokpal.
There is a difference between the nature of cases investigated by the
National Investigation Agency (NIA) and the CBI. The NIA has been
constituted after the Mumbai terror attack in 2008 mainly for investigation
of incidents of terrorist attacks, funding of terrorism and other terror related
crime, whereas the CBI investigates crime of corruption, economic offences
and serious and organized crime other than terrorism.
MOTTO, MISSION AND VISION OF CBI
Motto: Industry, Impartiality and Integrity Mission: To uphold the
Constitution of India and law of the land through in-depth investigation and
successful prosecution of offences; to provide leadership and direction to
police forces and to act as the nodal agency for enhancing inter-state and
international cooperation in law enforcement
Vision: Based on its motto, mission and the need to develop
professionalism, transparency, adaptability to change and use of science
and technology in its working, the CBI will focus on
1.  Combating corruption in public life, curbing economic and violent
crimes through meticulous investigation and prosecution
2.  Evolving effective systems and procedures for successful
investigation and prosecution of cases in various law courts
3.  Helping fight cyber and high technology crime
4.  Creating a healthy work environment that encourages teambuilding, free communication and mutual trust
5.  Supporting state police organisations and law enforcement agencies
in national and international cooperation, particularly relating to
enquiries and investigation of cases
6.  Playing a lead role in the war against national and transnational
organised crime
7.  Upholding human rights, protecting the environment, arts, antiques
and heritage of our civilisation
8.  Developing a scientific temper, humanism and the spirit of inquiry
and reform
9.  Striving for excellence and professionalism in all spheres of
functioning so that the organisation rises to high levels of endeavor
and achievement.
ORGANISATION OF CBI
Originally (1963), the CBI was set up with the following six divisions:
(i) Investigation and Anti-Corruption Division (Delhi Special Police
Establishment)
(ii) Technical Division
(iii) Crime Records and Statistics Division
(iv) Research Division
(v) Legal and General Division
(vi) Administration Division
At present (2019), the CBI has the following seven divisions:
1.  Anti-Corruption Division
2.  Economic Offences Division
3.  Special Crimes Division
4.  Policy and Coordination Division
5.  Administration Division
6.  Directorate of Prosecution
7.  Central Forensic Science Laboratory
COMPOSITION OF CBI
The CBI is headed by a Director. He is assisted by a special director or an
additional director. Additionally, it has a number of joint directors, deputy
inspector generals, superintendents of police and all other usual ranks of
police personnel. In total, it has about 5000 staff members, about 125
forensic scientists and about 250 law officers.
The Director of CBI as Inspector-General of Police, Delhi Special Police
Establishment, is responsible for the administration of the organisation.
With the enactment of CVC Act, 2003, the superintendence of Delhi
Special Police Establishment vests with the Central Government save
investigations of offences under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, in
which, the superintendence vests with the Central Vigilance Commission.
The Director of CBI has been provided security of two-year tenure in office
by the CVC Act, 2003.
The Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act (2013) amended the Delhi Special
Police Establishment Act (1946) and made the following changes with
respect to the composition of the CBI:
1.  The Central Government shall appoint the Director of CBI on the
recommendation of a three-member committee consisting of the Prime
Minister as Chairperson, the Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha
and the Chief Justice of India or Judge of the Supreme Court
nominated by him.
2.  There shall be a Directorate of prosecution headed by a Director for
conducting the prosecution of cases under the Lokpal and Lokayuktas
Act, 2013. The Director of Prosecution shall be an officer not below
the rank of Joint Secretary to the Government of India. He shall
function under the overall supervision and control of the Director of
CBI. He shall be appointed by the Central Government on the
recommendation of the Central Vigilance Commission. He shall hold
office for a period of two years.
3.  The Central Government shall appoint officers of the rank of SP
and above in the CBI on the recommendation of a committee
consisting of the Central Vigilance Commissioner as Chairperson, the
Vigilance Commissioners, the Secretary of the Home Ministry and the
Secretary of the Department of Personnel.
Later, the Delhi Special Police Establishment (Amendment) Act, 2014
made a change in the composition of the committee related to the
appointment of the Director of C.B.I. It states that where there is no
recognized leader of opposition in the Lok Sabha, then the leader of the
single largest opposition party in the Lok Sabha would be a member of that
committee.
FUNCTIONS OF CBI
The functions of CBI are:
(i) Investigating cases of corruption, bribery and misconduct of
Central government employees.
(ii) Investigating cases relating to infringement of fiscal and
economic laws, that is, breach of laws concerning export and
import control, customs and central excise, income tax, foreign
exchange regulations and so on. However, such cases are taken
up either in consultation with or at the request of the department
concerned.
(iii) Investigating serious crimes, having national and international
ramifications, committed by organised gangs of professional
criminals.
(iv) Coordinating the activities of the anticorruption agencies and the
various state police forces
(v) Taking up, on the request of a state government, any case of
public importance for investigation.
(vi) Maintaining crime statistics and disseminating criminal
information.
The CBI is a multidisciplinary investigation agency of the Government
of India and undertakes investigation of corruption-related cases, economic
offences and cases of conventional crime. It normally confines its activities
in the anti-corruption field to offences committed by the employees of the
Central Government and Union Territories and their public sector
undertakings. It takes up investigation of conventional crimes like murder,
kidnapping, rape etc., on reference from the state governments or when
directed by the Supreme Court/High Courts.
The CBI acts as the “National Central Bureau” of Interpol in India. The
Interpol Wing of the CBI coordinates requests for investigation-related
activities originating from Indian law enforcement agencies and the
member countries of the Interpol.
PROVISION OF PRIOR PERMISSION
The CBI is required to obtain the prior approval of the Central Government
before conducting any inquiry or investigation into an offence committed
by officers of the rank of joint secretary and above in the Central
Government and its authorities.
However, on May 6, 2014, the Supreme Court held as invalid the legal
provision that makes prior sanction mandatory for the Central Bureau of
Investigation to conduct a probe against senior bureaucrats in corruption
cases under the Prevention of Corruption Act.2
A Constitution Bench held that Section 6A of the Delhi Special Police
Establishment Act, which granted protection to joint secretary and above
officers from facing even a preliminary inquiry by the CBI in corruption
cases, was violative of Article 14.
Welcoming the court order, CBI Director said: “It is a landmark
judgment that will empower the agency in the investigations into several
cases pending due to the provision that has now been struck down by the
Constitution Bench. We had for long been of the view that inquiry against
senior officials need not require any prior permission.”
Writing the judgment, the CJI said, “Corruption is an enemy of [the]
nation and tracking down a corrupt public servant, howsoever high he may
be, and punishing such person is a necessary mandate under the PC Act,
1988. The status or position of a public servant does not qualify the person
from exemption from equal treatment. The decision-making power does not
segregate corrupt officers into two classes as they are common crime doers
and have to be tracked down by the same process of inquiry and
investigation.”
The Bench said, “Section 6A of the DSPE Act [granting protection to one
set of officers] is directly destructive and runs counter to the object and
reason of the PC Act, 1988. It also undermines the object of detecting and
punishing high-level corruption. How can two public servants against
whom there are allegations of corruption or graft or bribe taking or criminal
misconduct under the PC Act, 1988, be made to be treated differently
because one happens to be a junior officer and the other a senior decision
maker?”
“The provision in Section 6A impedes tracking down the corrupt senior
bureaucrats as without previous approval of the Central Government, the
CBI cannot even hold preliminary inquiry much less an investigation into
the allegations. The protection under Section 6A has propensity of shielding
the corrupt,” the Bench added.
Observing that there could not be any protection to corrupt public
servants, the Bench said, “The aim and object of investigation is ultimately
to search for truth and any law that impedes that object may not stand the
test of Article 14. Breach of rule of law, in our opinion, amounts to negation
of equality under Article 14. Section 6-A fails in the context of these facets
of Article 14.”
CBI VS. STATE POLICE
The role of the Special Police Establishment (a division of CBI) is
supplementary to that of the state police forces. Along with state police
forces, the Special Police Establishment (SPE) enjoys the concurrent
powers of investigation and prosecution for offences under the Delhi Police
Establishment Act, 1946. However, to avoid duplication and overlapping of
cases between these two agencies, the following administrative
arrangements have been made:
(i) The SPE shall take up such cases which are essentially and
substantially concerned with the Central Government’s affairs or
employees, even if they also involve certain state government
employees.
(ii) The state police force shall take up such cases which are
substantially concerned with the state government’s affairs or
employees, even if they also involve certain Central Government
employees.
(iii) The SPE shall also take up cases against employees of public
undertakings or statutory bodies established and financed by the
Central Government.
CBI ACADEMY
The CBI Academy is located at Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh and started
functioning in 1996. Earlier, training programmes were being conducted at
the CBI Training Centre, New Delhi.
The vision of the CBI Academy is “Excellence in Training in the Fields
of Crime Investigation, Prosecution and Vigilance Functioning” and its
mission is to train the human resources of CBI, state police and the
vigilance organisations to become professional, industrious, impartial,
upright and dedicated to the service of the nation.
The academy is the focal point of training activities within the
organisation and is responsible for identification of suitable training
programmes, regulation of nominations of trainees and preparation of the
annual training calendar.
Beside the CBI Academy at Ghaziabad, there are three regional training
centres imparting training at regional levels at Kolkata, Mumbai and
Chennai.
There are two kinds of training courses which are being conducted in the
CBI Academy:
(i) Short Term In-service Courses: For officers of the CBI, state
police, central para-military forces and central government
undertakings
(ii) Long Term Basic Courses: For directly recruited deputy
superintendents of police, sub-inspectors and constables of CBI.3

61 Lokpal and Lokayuktas
GLOBAL SCENARIO
Modern democratic states are characterised by a welfare orientation. Hence,
the government has come to play an important role in the socio-economic
development of a nation. This has resulted in the expansion of bureaucracy
and the multiplication of administrative process, which in turn increased the
administrative power and discretion enjoyed by the civil servants at
different levels of the government. The abuse of this power and discretion
by civil servants opens up scope for harassment, malpractices,
maladministration and corruption. Such a situation gives rise to citizens’
grievances against administration1
 .
The success of democracy and the realisation of socio-economic
development depends on the extent to which the citizens’ grievances are
redressed. Therefore, the following institutional devices have been created
in different parts of the world to deal with the redressal of these grievances:
1.  The Ombudsman System
2.  The Administrative Courts System
3.  The Procurator System
The earliest democratic institution created in the world for the redressal
of citizens’ grievance is the Scandinavian institution of Ombudsman.
Donald C. Rowat, an international authority on the Ombudsman, calls it a
“uniquely appropriate institution for dealing with the average citizens’
complaints about unfair administrative actions.”
The institution of Ombudsman was first created in Sweden in 1809.
‘Ombud’ is a Swedish term and refers to a person who acts as the
representative or spokesman of another person. According to Donald C.
Rowat, Ombudsman refers to “an officer appointed by the legislature to
handle complaints against administrative and judicial action.”
The Swedish Ombudsman deals with the citizens’ grievances in the
following matters:
(i) Abuse of administrative discretion, that is, misuse of official
power and authority
(ii) Maladministration, that is, inefficiency in achieving the targets
(iii) Administrative corruption, that is, demanding bribery for doing
things
(iv) Nepotism, that is supporting one’s own kith and kin in matters
like providing employment
(v) Discourtesy, that is, misbehaviour of various kinds, for instance,
use of abusive language.
The Swedish Ombudsman is appointed by the Parliament for a term of
four years. He can be removed only by the Parliament on ground of its loss
of confidence in him. He submits his annual report to the Parliament and
hence, is also known as ‘Parliamentary Ombudsman.’ But he is independent
of the Parliament (legislature) as well as the executive and judiciary.
The Ombudsman is a constitutional authority and enjoys the powers to
supervise the compliance of laws and regulations by the public officials,
and see that they discharge their duties properly. In other words, he keeps a
watch over all public officials–civil, judicial and military–so that they
function impartially, objectively and legally, that is, in accordance with the
law. However, he has no power to reverse or quash a decision and has no
direct control over administration or the courts.
The Ombudsman can act either on the basis of a complaint received from
the citizen against unfair administrative action or suo moto (i.e. on his own
initiative). He can prosecute any erring official including the judges.
However, he himself cannot inflict any punishment. He only reports the
matter to the higher authorities for taking the necessary corrective action.
In sum, the characteristics of the Swedish institution of Ombudsman are
as follows:
(i) Independence of action from the executive
(ii) Impartial and objective investigation of complaints
(iii) Suo moto power to start investigations
(iv) Uninterrupted access to all the files of administration
(v) Right to report to the Parliament as opposed to the executive; the
institution of ombudsman is based on the doctrine of
administrative accountability to legislature.
(vi) Wide publicity given to its working in press and other media
(vii) Direct, simple, informal, cheap and speedy method of handling
complaints
From Sweden, the institution of Ombudsman spread to other
Scandinavian countries– Finland (1919), Denmark (1955) and Norway
(1962). New Zealand is the first Commonwealth country in the world to
have adopted the Ombudsman system in the form of a Parliamentary
Commissioner for Investigation in 1962. The United Kingdom adopted
Ombudsman-like institution called Parliamentary Commissioner for
Administration in 1967. Since then, more than 40 counties of the world
have adopted Ombudsman-like institutions with different nomenclature and
functions. The Ombudsman in India is called Lokpal/Lokayukta. Donald. C.
Rowat says that the institution of Ombudsman is a “bulkwork of democratic
government against the tyranny of officialdom.” While Gerald E. Caiden
described the Ombudsman as “institutionalised public conscience.”
Another unique institutional device created for the redressal of citizens’
grievances against administrative authorities, is the French system of
Administrative Courts. Due to its success in France, the system has
gradually spread to many other European and African countries like
Belgium, Greece and Turkey.
The socialist countries like the former USSR (now Russia), China,
Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Romania have created their own
institutional device for the redressal of citizens’ grievances. It is called
‘Procurator System’ in these countries. It should be noted here that the
office of the Procurator-General is still functioning in Russia. He is
appointed for a tenure of seven years.
POSITION IN INDIA
The existing legal and institutional framework to check corruption and
redress citizens’ grievances in India consists of the following:
1.  Public Servants (Enquiries) Act, 1850
2.  Indian Penal Code, 1860
3.  Special Police Establishment, 1941
4.  Delhi Police Establishment Act, 1946
5.  Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988
6.  Commissions of Inquiry Act, 1952 (against political leaders and
eminent public men)
7.  All-India Services (Conduct) Rules, 1968
8.  Central Civil Services (Conduct) Rules, 1964
9.  Railway Services (Conduct) Rules, 1966
10.  Vigilance organisations in ministries / departments, attached and
subordinate offices and public undertakings
11.  Central Bureau of Investigation, 1963
12.  Central Vigilance Commission, 1964
13.  State Vigilance Commissions, 1964
14.  Anti corruption bureaus in states
15.  Lokpal (Ombudsman) at the Centre
16.  Lokayukta (Ombudsman) in states
17.  Divisional Vigilance Board
18.  District Vigilance Officer
19.  National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission
20.  National Commission for SCs
21.  National Commission for STs
22.  Supreme Court and High Courts in states
23.  Administrative Tribunals (quasi-judicial bodies)
24.  Directorate of Public Grievances in the Cabinet Secretariat, 1988
25.  Parliament and its committees
26.  ‘File to Field’ programme in some states like Kerala. In this
innovative scheme, the administrator goes to the village/area and hears
public grievances and takes immediate action wherever possible.
LOKPAL
The Administrative Reforms Commission (ARC) of India (1966–1970)
recommended the setting up of two special authorities designated as
‘Lokpal’ and ‘lokayukta’ for the redressal of citizens’ grievances2
. These
institutions were to be set up on the pattern of the institution of Ombudsman
in Scandinavian countries and the parliamentary commissioner for
investigation in New Zealand. The Lokpal would deal with complaints
against ministers and secretaries at Central and state levels, and the
lokayukta (one at the Centre and one in every state) would deal with
complaints against other specified higher officials. The ARC kept the
judiciary outside the purview of Lokpal and lokayukta as in New Zealand.
But, in Sweden the judiciary is within the purview of Ombudsman.
According to the ARC, the Lokpal would be appointed by the president
after consultation with the chief justice of India, the Speaker of Lok Sabha
and the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha.
The ARC also recommended that the institutions of Lokpal and
lokayukta should have the following features:
1.  They should be demonstratively independent and impartial.
2.  Their investigations and proceedings should be conducted in private
and should be informal in character.
3.  Their appointment should be, as far as possible, non-political.
4.  Their status should compare with the highest judicial functionaries
in the country.
5.  They should deal with matters in the discretionary field involving
acts of injustice, corruption or favouritism.
6.  Their proceedings should not be subject to judicial interference.
7.  They should have the maximum latitude and powers in obtaining
information relevant to their duties.
8.  They should not look forward to any benefit or pecuniary advantage
from the executive government.
The Government of India accepted the recommendations of ARC in this
regard. So far, ten official attempts have been made to bring about
legislation on this subject. Bills were introduced in the Parliament in the
following years:
1.  In May 1968, by the Congress Government headed by Indira
Gandhi.
2.  In April 1971, again by the Congress Government headed by Indira
Gandhi.
3.  In July 1977, by the Janata Government headed by Morarji Desai.
4.  In August 1985, by the Congress Government headed by Rajiv
Gandhi.
5.  In December 1989, by the National Front Government headed by
V.P. Singh.
6.  In September 1996, by the United Front Government headed by
Deve Gowda.
7.  In August 1998, by the BJP-led coalition Government headed by
A.B. Vajpayee.
8.  In August 2001, by the NDA government headed by A.B. Vajpayee.
9.  In August 2011, by the UPA government headed by Manmohan
Singh.
10.  In December 2011, by the UPA government headed by Manmohan
Singh.
The first four bills lapsed due to the dissolution of Lok Sabha, while the
fifth one was withdrawn by the government. The sixth and seventh bills
also lapsed due to the dissolution of the 11th and 12th Lok Sabha. Again,
the eighth bill (2001) lapsed due to the dissolution of the 13th Lok Sabha in
2004. The ninth bill (2011) was withdrawn by the government.
LOKPAL AND LOKAYUKTAS ACT (2013)
Features
The salient features of the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act (2013) are as
follows.3
1.  It seeks to establish the institution of the Lokpal at the Centre and
the Lokayukta at the level of the State and thus seeks to provide a
uniform vigilance and anti-corruption road map for the nation both at
the Centre and at the States. The jurisdiction of Lokpal includes the
Prime Minister, Ministers, Members of Parliament and Groups A, B, C
and D officers and officials of the Central Government.
2.  The Lokpal to consist of a Chairperson with a maximum of 8
members of which 50% shall be judicial members.
3.  50% of the members of the Lokpal shall come from amongst the
SCs, the STs, the OBCs, minorities and women.
4.  The selection of the Chairperson and the members of Lokpal shall
be through a Selection Committee consisting of the Prime Minister, the
Speaker of the Lok Sabha, the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok
Sabha, the Chief Justice of India or a sitting Supreme Court Judge
nominated by the Chief Justice of India and an eminent jurist to be
nominated by the President of India on the basis of recommendations
of the first four members of the selection committee.
5.  A Search Committee will assist the Selection Committee in the
process of selection. 50% of the members of the Search Committee
shall also be from amongst the SCs, the STs, the OBCs, minorities and
women.
6.  The Prime Minister has been brought under the purview of the
Lokpal with subject matter exclusions and specific process for
handling complaints against the Prime Minister.
7.  Lokpal’s jurisdiction will cover all categories of public servants,
including Group A, Group B, Group C, and Group D officers and
employees of Government. On complaints referred to the CVC by the
Lokpal, the CVC will send its report of preliminary enquiry in respect
of Group A and Group B Officers back to the Lokpal for further
decision. With respect to categories of employees from Group C and
Group D, the CVC will proceed further in exercise of its own powers
under the CVC Act subject to reporting and review by the Lokpal.
8.  The Lokpal will have the power of superintendence and direction
over any investigating agency, including the CBI, for cases referred to
them by the Lokpal.
9.  A High-Powered Committee chaired by the Prime Minister will
recommend the selection of the Director of CBI.
10.  It incorporates provisions for attachment and confiscation of
property of public servants acquired by corrupt means, even while the
prosecution is pending.
11.  It lays down clear timelines. For preliminary enquiry, it is three
months extendable by three months. For investigation, it is six months
which may be extended by six months at a time. For trial, it is one year
extendable by one year and to achieve this, special courts to be set up.
12.  It enhances maximum punishment under the Prevention of
Corruption Act from seven years to ten years. The minimum
punishment under sections 7, 8, 9 and 12 of the Prevention of
Corruption Act will now be three years, and the minimum punishment
under section 15 (punishment for attempt) will now be two years.
13.  Institutions which are financed fully or partly by Government are
under the jurisdiction of Lokpal, but institutions aided by Government
are excluded.
14.  It provides adequate protection for honest and upright public
servants.
15.  Lokpal conferred with power to grant sanction for prosecution of
public servants in place of the Government or competent authority.
16.  It contains a number of provisions aimed at strengthening the CBI
such as:
(i) setting up of a Directorate of Prosecution headed by a
Director of Prosecution under the overall control of the
Director of CBI;
(ii) appointment of the Director of Prosecution on the
recommendation of the CVC;
(iii) maintenance of a panel of advocates by CBI other than
Government advocates with the consent of the Lokpal for
handling Lokpal-referred cases;
(iv) transfer of officers of CBI investigating cases referred by
Lokpal with the approval of Lokpal;
(v) provision of adequate funds to CBI for investigating cases
referred by Lokpal.
17.  All entities receiving donations from foreign source in the context
of the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) in excess of ₹10
lakhs per year are brought under the jurisdiction of Lokpal.
18.  It contains a mandate for setting up of the institution of Lokayukta
through enactment of a law by the State Legislature within a period of
365 days from the date of commencement of this Act. Thus, the Act
provides freedom to the states to decide upon the contours of the
Lokayukta mechanism in their respective states.
Drawbacks
The following are the drawbacks (shortcomings) of the Lokpal and
Lokayuktas Act, 20133a
:
1.  Lokpal cannot suo motu proceed against any public servant.
2.  Emphasis on form of complaint rather than substance.
3.  Heavy punishment for false and frivolous complaints against public
servants may deter complaints being filed to Lokpal.
4.  Anonymous complaints not allowed -Can’t just make a complaint
on plain paper and drop it in a box with supporting documents.
5.  Legal assistance to public servant against whom complaint is filed.
6.  Limitation period of 7 years to file complaints.
7.  Very non-transparent procedure for dealing with complaints against
the PM.
LOKAYUKTAS
Even much before the enactment of the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act (2013)
itself, many states had already set up the institution of Lokayuktas.
It must be noted here that the institution of lokayukta was established
first in Maharashtra in 1971. Although Odisha had passed the Act in this
regard in 1970, it came into force only in 1983.
Till 2013, 21 states and 1 Union Territory (Delhi) have established the
institution of Lokyuktas. The details in this regard are mentioned below in
Table 61.1.
Table 61.1  Establishment of Lokayukta in States (Chronological Order)
Sl. No. States/UTs Created in (enacted in)

19.  Jammu and Kashmir 3b 2002 
20.  West Bengal  2003 
21.  Tripura  2008 
22.  Goa  2011 
The various aspects of the institution of lokayukta are:
Structural Variations
The structure of the lokayukta is not same in all the states. Some States like
Rajasthan, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra have created the
lokayukta as well as upalo-kayukta, while some others like Bihar, Uttar
Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh have created only the lokayukta. There are
still other states like Punjab and Orissa that have designated officials as
Lokpal. This pattern was not suggested by the ARC in the states.
Appointment
The lokayukta and upalokayukta are appointed by the governor of the state.
While appointing, the governor in most of the states consults (a) the chief
justice of the state high court, and (b) the leader of Opposition in the state
legislative assembly4
 .
Qualifications
Judicial qualifications are prescribed for the lokayukta in the States of Uttar
Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Orissa, Karnataka
and Assam. But no specific qualifications are prescribed in the states of
Bihar, Maharashtra and Rajasthan.
Tenure
In most of the states, the term of office fixed for lokayukta is of 5 years
duration or 65 years of age, whichever is earlier. He is not eligible for
reappointment for a second term.
Jurisdiction
There is no uniformity regarding the jurisdiction of lokayukta in all the
states. The following points can be noted in this regard:
(a)  The chief minister is included within the jurisdiction of lokayukta
in the states of Himachal Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh
and Gujarat, while he is excluded from the purview of loka-yukta in
the states of Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Bihar and Orissa.
(b)  Ministers and higher civil servants are included in the purview of
lokayukta in almost all the states. Maharashtra has also included
former ministers and civil servants.
(c)  Members of state legislatures are included in the purview of
lokayukta in the States of Andhra Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Gujarat,
Uttar Pradesh and Assam.
(d)  The authorities of the local bodies, corporations, companies and
societies are included in the jurisdiction of the lokayukta in most of the
states.
Investigations
In most of the states, the lokayukta can initiate investigations either on the
basis of a complaint received from the citizen against unfair administrative
action or suo moto. But he does not enjoy the power to start investigations
on his own initiative (suo moto) in the States of Uttar Pradesh, Himachal
Pradesh and Assam.
Scope of Cases Covered
The lokayukta can consider the cases of ‘grievances’ as well as ‘allegations’
in the States of Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Assam, Bihar and Karnataka.
But, in Himachal Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan and Gujarat, the job
of lokayuktas is confined to investigating allegations (corruption) and not
grievances (maladministration).
Other Features
1.  The lokayukta presents, annually, to the governor of the state a
consolidated report on his performance. The governor places this
report along with an explanatory memorandum before the state
legislature. The lokayukta is responsible to the state legislature.
2.  He takes the help of the state investigating agencies for conducting
inquiries.
3.  He can call for relevant files and documents from the state
government departments.
4.  The recommendations made by the loka-yukta are only advisory
and not binding on the state government.
NOTES AND REFERENCES

of complaint; a condition felt to be oppressive or wrongful’.

legislative assembly is not required to be consulted in this regard. In
Karnataka, on the other hand, the Chairman of the state legislative
council, the Speaker of the state legislative assembly and the leader of
Opposition in the state legislative council are also required to be
consulted on this matter.
62 National Investigation Agency
ESTABLISHMENT OF THE NIA
The National Investigation Agency (NIA) was constituted in 2009 under the
provisions of the National Investigation Agency Act, 2008 (NIA Act). It is
the central counter-terrorism law enforcement agency in the country.
The NIA was established in the backdrop of the 2008 Mumbai terror
attacks, popularly known as the 26/11 incident. This national horror led to
the realisation of the need for a separate federal agency to deal with terrorrelated crimes in the country.
The headquarters of the NIA is at New Delhi. The branch offices of the
NIA are located at Hyderabad, Guwahati, Mumbai, Lucknow, Kochi,
Kolkata, Jammu and Raipur. In addition, the NIA has a separate specialised
cell known as TFFC Cell dealing with the subjects of fake currency notes
and terror funding.
The NIA is headed by a Director-General. He is appointed by the central
government. His powers are similar to the powers exercisable by a DirectorGeneral of Police in respect of the police force in a state.
The NIA works under the administrative control of the Ministry of Home
Affairs, Government of India. The state government extends all assistance
and co-operation to the NIA for investigation of the offences specified
under the NIA Act.
RATIONALE OF THE NIA
While introducing the NIA Bill in the Parliament, the Government of India
gave the following reasons for creating the NIA1
 :
1.  Over the past several years, India has been the victim of large-scale
terrorism sponsored from across the borders. There have been
innumerable incidents of terrorist attacks, not only in the militancy and
insurgency affected areas and areas affected by left-wing extremism,
but also in the form of terrorist attacks and bomb blasts, etc., in various
parts of the hinterland and major cities, etc.
2.  A large number of such incidents are found to have complex interstate and international linkages, and possible connection with other
activities like the smuggling of arms and drugs, pushing in and
circulation of fake Indian currency, infiltration from across the borders,
etc.
3.  Keeping all these in view, it was felt that there was a need for
setting up of an agency at the central level for the investigation of
offences related to terrorism and certain other Acts, which have
national ramifications.
4.  Several expert committees and the Second Administrative Reforms
Commission2 have also made recommendations for establishing such
an agency.
5.  The Government, after due consideration and examination of the
issues involved, proposed to enact a legislation to make provisions for
establishment of an NIA in a concurrent jurisdiction framework, with
provisions for taking up specific cases under specific Acts for
investigation. These provisions are proposed to be incorporated in the
National Investigation Agency Bill, 2008.
FUNCTIONS OF THE NIA
The NIA is mandated to investigate and prosecute offences under the
various Acts mentioned in the Schedule of the NIA Act. In pursuance of its
mandate, the NIA collects, collates and analyses counter-terrorism
investigation. It also shares inputs with its sister intelligence agencies and
law enforcement units both at central and state governments level.
In more detail, the functions assigned to the NIA are as follows3
 :
(a)  To investigate and prosecute offences in respect of the Acts
specified in the Schedule of the NIA Act.
(b)  To provide assistance to, and seek assistance from, other
intelligence and investigation agencies of the central government and
state governments.
(c)  To take other such measures which may be necessary for speedy
and effective implementation of the provisions of the NIA Act.
VISION OF THE NIA
The following points highlight the vision of the NIA:
1.  The NIA aims to be a thoroughly professional investigative agency
matching the best international standards.
2.  The NIA aims to set the standards of excellence in counterterrorism and other national security-related investigations at the
national level by developing into a highly trained, partnership-oriented
workforce.
3.  The NIA aims at creating deterrence for existing and potential
terrorist groups/ individuals.
4.  The NIA aims to develop as a storehouse of all terrorist-related
information.
MISSION OF THE NIA
The mission of the NIA is as follows:
1.  In-depth professional investigation of scheduled offences using the
latest scientific methods of investigation and setting up such standards
as to ensure that all cases entrusted to the NIA are detected.
2.  Ensuring effective and speedy trial.
3.  Developing into a thoroughly professional, result-oriented
organisation, upholding the Constitution of India and laws of the land,
giving prime importance to the protection of human rights and dignity
of the individual.
4.  Developing a professional workforce through regular training and
exposure to the best practices and procedures.
5.  Displaying scientific temper and progressive spirit while
discharging the duties assigned.
6.  Inducting modern methods and latest technology in every sphere of
activities of the agency.
7.  Maintaining professional and cordial relations with the
governments of states and union territories and other law enforcement
agencies in compliance with the legal provisions of the NIA Act.
8.  Assisting all states and other investigating agencies in investigation
of terrorist cases.
9.  Building a database on all terrorist-related information and sharing
the available database with the states and other agencies.
10.  Studying and analysing laws relating to terrorism in other
countries and regularly evaluating the adequacy of existing laws in
India and proposing changes as and when necessary.
11.  Winning the confidence of the citizens of India through selfless
and fearless endeavours.
JURISDICTION OF THE NIA
The NIA has concurrent jurisdiction to investigate and prosecute the
offences affecting the sovereignty, security and integrity of India, security
of state, friendly relations with foreign states and offences under various
Acts enacted to implement international treaties, agreements, conventions
and resolutions of the UNO, its agencies and other international
organisations.
The NIA is empowered to probe terror attacks including bomb blasts,
hijacking of aircrafts and ships, attacks on nuclear installations and use of
weapons of mass destruction.
In 2019, the jurisdiction of the NIA was extended4
. Consequently, the
NIA is also empowered to probe the offences relating to human trafficking,
counterfeit currency or bank notes, manufacture or sale of prohibited arms,
cyber-terrorism and explosive substances.
NIA (AMENDMENT) ACT, 2019
The various features or provisions of the amendment are as follows5
 :
1.  It applied the provisions of the NIA Act also to persons who
commit a scheduled offence beyond India against Indian citizens or
affecting the interest of India.
2.  It provided that the officers of the NIA shall have the similar
powers, duties, privies and liabilities being exercised by the police
officers in connection with the investigation of offences, not only in
India but also outside India.
3.  It empowered the central government, with respect to a scheduled
offence committed outside India, to direct the NIA to register the case
and take up investigation as if such offence has taken place in India.
4.  It provided that the central government and the state governments
may designate Sessions Courts as Special Courts for conducting the
trial of offences under the NIA Act.
5.  It inserted certain new offences in the Schedule of the NIA Act6

63 National Disaster Management
Authority
ESTABLISHMENT OF THE NDMA
The Government of India, recognising the importance of disaster
management as a national priority, had set up a High Powered Committee in
1999 and a National Committee in 2001 after the Gujarat earthquake, to
make recommendations on the preparation of disaster management plans
and suggest effective mitigation mechanisms. However, after the Indian
Ocean tsunami of 2004, the Government of India took a defining step in the
legislative history of the country by enacting the Disaster Management Act,
20051
 .
The Act provided for the creation of the National Disaster Management
Authority (NDMA) to spearhead and implement a holistic and integrated
approach to disaster management in the country. Initially, the NDMA was
constituted in 2005 by an Executive Order of the Government of India.
Subsequently, the NDMA was notified in 2006 under the provisions of the
Act2
 .
The NDMA consists of a chairperson and other members, not exceeding

64 Co-operative Societies
The 97th Constitutional Amendment Act of 2011 gave a constitutional
status and protection to co-operative societies. In this context, it made the
following three changes in the constitution:
1.  It made the right to form co-operative societies a fundamental right
(Article 191
 ).
2.  It included a new Directive Principle of State Policy on promotion
of co-operative societies (Article 43-B2
 ).
3.  It added a new Part IX-B in the Constitution which is entitled “The
Co-operative Societies” (Articles 243-ZH to 243-ZT).
CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS
Part IX-B of the constitution contains the following provisions with respect
to the cooperative societies:
Incorporation of Co-operative Societies: The state legislature may make
provisions for the incorporation, regulation and winding-up of co-operative
societies based on the principles of voluntary formation, democratic
membercontrol, member-economic participation and autonomous
functioning.

number of such co-opted members shall not exceed two (in addition to
twenty-one directors). Further, the co-opted members shall not have the
right to vote in any election of the co-operative society or be eligible to be
elected as office bearers of the board.
The functional directors of a co-operative society shall also be the
members of the board and such members shall be excluded for the purpose
of counting the total number of directors (that is, twenty-one).
Election of Members of Board: The election of a board shall be conducted
before the expiry of the term of the board so as to ensure that the newly
elected members assume office immediately on the expiry of the term of the
office of members of the outgoing board.
The superintendence, direction and control of the preparation of electoral
rolls and the conduct of elections to a co-operative society shall vest in such

auditors and auditing firms that shall be eligible for auditing the accounts of
the co-operative societies.
Every co-operative society shall be audited by an auditor or auditing

Continuance of Existing Laws: Any provision of any law relating to cooperative societies in force in a state immediately before the
commencement of the Constitution (Ninetyseventh Amendment) Act, 2011,
which is inconsistent with the provisions of this part, shall continue to be in
force until amended or repealed or until the expiration of one year from
such commencement, whichever is less.7
REASONS FOR THE 97TH
 AMENDMENT
The reasons for adding the above provisions in the Constitution by the 97th
Constitutional Amendment Act of 2011 are as follows:
1.  The co-operative sector, over the years, has made significant
contribution to various sectors of national economy and has achieved
voluminous growth. However, it has shown weaknesses in
safeguarding the interests of the members and fulfilment of objects for
which these institutions were organised. There have been instances
where elections have been postponed indefinitely and nominated office
bearers or administrators have remained in-charge of these institutions
for a long time. This reduces the accountability in the management of
co-operative societies to their members. Inadequate professionalism in
management in many of the co-operative institutions has led to poor
services and low productivity. Co-operatives need to run on well
established democratic principles and elections held on time and in a
free and fair manner. Therefore, there was a need to initiate
fundamental reforms to revitalise these institutions in order to ensure
their contribution in the economic development of the country and to
serve the interests of members and public at large and also to ensure
their autonomy, democratic functioning and professional management.
2.  The “co-operative societies” is a subject enumerated in Entry 32 of
the state list of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution and the state
legislatures have accordingly enacted legislations on co-operative
societies. Within the framework of State Acts, growth of co-operatives
on large scale was envisaged as part of the efforts for securing social
and economic justice and equitable distribution of the fruits of
development. It has, however, been experienced that in spite of
considerable expansion of co-operatives, their performance in
qualitative terms has not been up to the desired level. Considering the
need for reforms in the Co-operative Societies Acts of the States,
consultations with the State Governments have been held at several
occasions and in the conferences of state co-operative ministers. A
strong need has been felt for amending the Constitution so as to keep
the co-operatives free from unnecessary outside interferences and also
to ensure their autonomous organisational set up and their democratic
functioning.
3.  The Central Government was committed to ensure that the cooperative societies in the country function in a democratic,
professional, autonomous and economically sound manner. With a
view to bring the necessary reforms, it was proposed to incorporate a
new part in the Constitution so as to provide for certain provisions
covering the vital aspects of working of co-operative societies like
democratic, autonomous and professional functioning. It was expected
that these provisions will not only ensure the autonomous and
democratic functioning of co-operatives, but also ensure the
accountability of management to the members and other stakeholders
and shall provide for deterrence for violation of the provisions of the
law.

before February 14, 2013.
65 Official Language
Part XVII of the Constitution deals with the official language in Articles
343 to 351. Its provisions are divided into four heads–Language of the
Union, Regional languages, Language of the judiciary and texts of laws and
Special directives.
LANGUAGE OF THE UNION
The Constitution contains the following provisions in respect of the official
language of the Union.
1.  Hindi written in Devanagari script is to be the official language of
the Union. But, the form of numerals to be used for the official
purposes of the Union has to be the international form of Indian
numerals and not the Devanagari form of numerals.
2.  However, for a period of fifteen years from the commencement of
the Constitution (i.e., from 1950 to 1965), the English language would
continue to be used for all the official purposes of the Union for which
it was being used before 1950.
3.  Even after fifteen years, the Parliament may provide for the
continued use of English language for the specified purposes.
4.  At the end of five years, and again at the end of ten years, from the
commencement of the Constitution, the president should appoint a
commission to make recommendations with regard to the progressive
use of the Hindi language, restrictions on the use of the English
language and other related issues1
 .
5.  A committee of Parliament is to be constituted to examine the
recommendations of the commission and to report its views on them to
the president2
 .
Accordingly, in 1955, the president appointed an Official Language
Commission under the chairmanship of B.G. Kher. The commission
submitted its report to the President in 1956. The report was examined by a
committee of Parliament constituted in 1957 under the chairmanship of
Gobind Ballabh Pant. However, another Official Language Commission (as
envisaged by the Constitution) was not appointed in 1960.
Subsequently, the Parliament enacted the Official Languages Act in
1963. The act provides for the continued use of English (even after 1965),
in addition to Hindi, for all official purposes of the Union and also for the
transaction of business in Parliament. Notably, this act enables the use of
English indefinitely (without any time-limit). Further, this act was amended
in 1967 to make the use of English, in addition to Hindi, compulsory in
certain cases3
 .
REGIONAL LANGUAGES
The Constitution does not specify the official language of different states. In
this regard, it makes the following provisions:
1.  The legislature of a state may adopt any one or more of the
languages in use in the state or Hindi as the official language of that
state. Until that is done, English is to continue as official language of
that state.
Under this provision, most of the states have adopted the major
regional language as their official language. For example, Andhra
Pradesh has adopted Telugu, Kerala–Malayalam, Assam–Assamese,
West Bengal–Bengali, Odisha–Odia. The nine northern states of
Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh,
Chhattisgarh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Haryana and Rajasthan have adopted
Hindi. Gujarat has adopted Hindi in addition to Gujarati. Similarly,
Goa has adopted Marathi in addition to Konkani. Jammu and Kashmir
has adopted Urdu (and not Kashmiri). On the other hand, certain northeastern States like Meghalaya, Arunachal Pradesh and Nagaland have
adopted English. Notably, the choice of the state is not limited to the
languages enumerated in the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution.
2.  For the time being, the official language of the Union (i.e., English)
would remain the link language for communications between the
Union and the states or between various states. But, two or more states
are free to agree to use Hindi (instead of English) for communication
between themselves. Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and
Bihar are some of the states that have entered into such agreements.
The Official Languages Act (1963) lays down that English should
be used for purposes of communication between the Union and the
non-Hindi states (that is, the states that have not adopted Hindi as their
official language). Further, where Hindi is used for communication
between a Hindi and a non-Hindi state, such communication in Hindi
should be accompanied by an English translation.
3.  When the President (on a demand being made) is satisfied that a
substantial proportion of the population of a state desire the use of any
language spoken by them to be recognised by that state, then he may
direct that such language shall also be officially recognised in that
state. This provision aims at protecting the linguistic interests of
minorities in the states.
LANGUAGE OF THE JUDICIARY AND TEXTS OF
LAWS
The constitutional provisions dealing with the language of the courts and
legislation are as follows:
1.  Until Parliament provides otherwise, the following are to be in the
English language only:
(a)  All proceedings in the Supreme Court and in every high court.
(b)  The authoritative texts of all bills, acts, ordinances, orders, rules,
regulations and bye-laws at the Central and state levels4
 .
2.  However, the governor of a state, with the previous consent of the
president, can authorise the use of Hindi or any other official language
of the state, in the proceedings in the high court of the state, but not
with respect to the judgements, decrees and orders passed by it. In
other words, the judgements, decrees and orders of the high court must
continue to be in English only (until Parliament otherwise provides).
3.  Similarly, a state legislature can prescribe the use of any language
(other than English) with respect to bills, acts, ordinances, orders,
rules, regulations or bye-laws, but a translation of the same in the
English language is to be published. The Official Languages Act of
1963 lays down that Hindi translation of acts, ordinances, orders,
regulations and bye-laws published under the authority of the president
are deemed to be authoritative texts. Further, every bill introduced in
the Parliament is to be accompanied by a Hindi translation. Similarly,
there is to be a Hindi translation of state acts or ordinances in certain
cases.
The act also enables the governor of a state, with the previous consent of
the president, to authorise the use of Hindi or any other official language of
the state for judgements, decrees and orders passed by the high court of the
state but they should be accompanied by an English translation. For
example, Hindi is used in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and
Rajasthan for this purpose.
However, the Parliament has not made any provision for the use of Hindi
in the Supreme Court. Hence, the Supreme Court hears only those who
petition or appeal in English. In 1971, a petitioner insisted on arguing in
Hindi a habeas corpus petition in the Supreme Court. But, the Court
cancelled his petition on the ground that the language of the Court was
English and allowing Hindi would be unconstitutional.
The Authorised Translations (Central Laws) Act of 1973 lays down that a
Translation in any regional language specified in the Eight Schedule to the
Constitution (other than Hindi) of any central act, ordinance, order, rule,
regulation and bye-law published under the authority of the President in the
Official Gazette is deemed to be the authoritative texts thereof in such
language.
SPECIAL DIRECTIVES
The Constitution contains certain special directives to protect the interests
of linguistic minorities and to promote the development of Hindi language.
There are:
Protection of Linguistic Minorities
In this regard, the Constitution makes the following provisions:
1.  Every aggrieved person has the right to submit a representation for
the redress of any grievance to any officer or authority of the Union or
a state in any of the languages used in the Union or in the state, as the
case may be. This means that a representation cannot be rejected on
the ground that it is not in the official language.
2.  Every state and a local authority in the state should provide
adequate facilities for instruction in the mother-tongue at the primary
stage of education to children belonging to linguistic minority groups.
The president can issue necessary directions for this purpose5
 .
3.  The president should appoint a special officer for linguistic
minorities to investigate all matters relating to the constitutional
safeguards for linguistic minorities and to report to him. The president
should place all such reports before the Parliament and send to the
state government concerned6
 .
Development of Hindi Language
The Constitution imposes a duty upon the Centre to promote the spread and
development of the Hindi language so that it may become the lingua franca
of the composite culture of India7
 .
Further, the Centre is directed to secure the enrichment of Hindi by
assimilating the forms, style and expressions used in hindustani and in other
languages specified in the Eighth Schedule and by drawing its vocabulary,
primarily on sanskrit and secondarily on other languages.
At present (2019), the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution specifies 22
languages (originally 14 languages). These are Assamese, Bengali, Bodo,
Dogri (Dongri), Gujarati, Hindi, Kannada, Kashmiri, Konkani, Mathili
(Maithili), Malayalam, Manipuri, Marathi, Nepali, Odia8
, Punjabi, Sanskrit,
Santhali, Sindhi, Tamil, Telugu and Urdu. Sindhi was added by the 21st
Amendment Act of 1967; Konkani, Manipuri and Nepali were added by the
71st Amendment Act of 1992; and Bodo, Dongri, Maithili and Santhali were
added by the 92nd
 Amendment Act of 2003.
In terms of the Constitution provisions, there are two objectives behind
the specification of the above regional languages in the Eighth Schedule:
(a)  the members of these languages are to be given representation in
the Official Language Commission; and
(b)  the forms, style and expression of these languages are to be used
for the enrichment of the Hindi language.
COMMITTEE OF PARLIAMENT ON OFFICIAL
LANGUAGE9
The Official Languages Act (1963) provided for the setting up of a
Committee of Parliament on Official Language to review the progress made
in the use of Hindi for the official purpose of the Union. Under the Act, this
Committee was to be constituted after ten years of the promulgation of the
Act (i.e., 26th January, 1965). Accordingly, this Committee was set up in
1976. This Committee comprises of 30 members of Parliament, 20 from
Lok Sabha and 10 from Rajya Sabha.
The Act contains the following provisions relating to the composition
and functions of the committee:
1.  After the expiration of ten years from the date on which the Act
comes into force, there shall be constituted a Committee on Official
Language, on a resolution to that effect being moved in either House
of Parliament with the previous sanction of the President and passed
by both Houses.
2.  The Committee shall consist of thirty members, of whom twenty
shall be members of the House of the People and ten shall be members
of the Council of States to be elected respectively by the members of
the House of the People and the members of the Council of States in
accordance with the system of proportional representation by means of
the single transferable vote.
3.  It shall be the duty of the Committee to review the progress made in
the use of Hindi for the official purposes of the Union and submit a
report to the President making recommendations thereon and the
President shall cause the report to be laid before each House of
Parliament and sent it to all the State Governments.
4.  The President may, after consideration of the report, and the views,
expressed by the State Governments thereon, issue directions in
accordance with the whole or any part of the report.
The Chairman of the Committee is elected by the members of the
Committee. As a convention, the Union Home Minister has been elected as
Chairman of the Committee from time to time.
The Committee is required to submit its report alongwith its
recommendations to the President after reviewing the position regarding the
use of Hindi in Central Government Offices on the basis of its observations.
Apart from adopting other methods for assessing the factual position, the
Committee decided to inspect certain Central Government offices
representing various fields of activities to motivate the Central Government
offices to adopt maximum usage of Hindi so that the objectives of the
Constitution and Official Languages Act provisions could be achieved.
With this end in view, the Committee set up three sub-Committees and for
the purpose of inspection by the three sub-Committees, the various
Ministries/Departments etc. were divided into three different groups.
Further, in order to assess the use of Official Language for various
purposes and other matters connected therewith, it was also decided to
invite eminent persons from various fields such as from education,
judiciary, voluntary organizations and the Secretaries of the
Ministries/Departments etc., for oral evidence.
The progressive use of Hindi in the Central Government offices is being
reviewed by the Committee in the background of the provisions relating to
Official Language as provided by the Constitution; the Official Languages
Act, 1963 and the Rules framed thereunder. The Committee also takes note
of the circulars/ instructions etc. issued by the Government in this regard
from time to time. The terms of reference of the Committee being
comprehensive, it has also been examining other relevant aspects like the
medium of instructions in schools, colleges and the universities; mode of
recruitment to Central Government services and medium of departmental
examination etc. Taking into consideration the magnitude of various aspects
of the Official Language policy and keeping in view the present
circumstances, the Committee in its meeting held in June, 1985 and August,
1986 decided to present its report to the President in parts; each part relating
to a particular aspect of the Official Language policy.
The Secretariat of the Committee is headed by the Secretary of the
Committee. The Secretary is assisted by the officers of the level of Under
Secretary and other officials. They extend all required assistance in
performing the various activities of the Committee. For administrative
purposes, this office is subordinate office of Department of Official
Language, Ministry of Home Affairs.
CLASSICAL LANGUAGE STATUS
In 2004, the Government of India decided to create new category of
languages called as “classical languages”. In 2006, it laid down the criteria
for conferring the classical language status.
So far (2019), the six languages are granted the classical language status.
This is shown below in Table 65.1.
Benefits
Once a language is declared classical, it gets financial assistance for setting
up a centre of excellence for the study of that language and also opens up an
avenue for two major awards for scholars of eminence. Besides, the
University Grants Commission can be requested to create - to begin with at
least in Central Universities - a certain number of professional chairs for
classical languages for scholars of eminence in the language.10

Criteria
The criteria for declaring a language as classical mandates high antiquity of
its early texts/recorded history over a period of 1,500–2,000 years, a body
of ancient lit-erature/texts which is considered a valuable heritage by
generations of speakers and a literary tradition that is original and not
borrowed from another speech community. Also since the classical
language and literature is distinct from the modern, there can also be a
discontinuity between the classical language and its later forms or its
offshoots.11

66 Public Services
CLASSIFICATION OF SERVICES
The public services (civil services or government services) in India are
classified into three categories–all-India services, Central services and state
services. Their meaning and composition are explained below:
All-India Services
All-India services are those services which are common to both Central and
state governments. The members of these services occupy top positions (or
key posts) under both the Centre and the states and serve them by turns.
At present, there are three all-India services. They are:
1.  Indian Administrative Service (IAS)
2.  Indian Police Service (IPS)
3.  Indian Forest Service (IFS)
In 1947, the Indian Civil Service (ICS) was replaced by IAS, and the
Indian Police (IP) was replaced by IPS and were recognised by the
Constitution as all-India services. In 1966, the Indian Forest Service was
established as the third all-India service1
 .
The All-India Services Act of 1951 authorised the Central government to
make rules in consultation with the state governments for the regulation of
recruitment and service conditions of the members of all-India services. The
members of these services are recruited and trained by the Central
government but are assigned to different states for work. They belong to
different state cadres; the Centre having no cadre of its own in this regard.
They serve the Central government on deputation and after completing their
fixed tenure they go back to their respective states. The Central government
obtains the services of these officers on deputation under the well-known
tenure system. It must be noted here that irrespective of their division
among different states, each of these all-India services form a single service
with common rights and status and uniform scales of pay throughout the
country. Their salaries and pensions are met by the states.
The all-India services are controlled jointly by the Central and state
governments. The ultimate control lies with the Central government while
the immediate control is vested in the state governments. Any disciplinary
action (imposition of penalties) against these officers can only be taken by
the Central government.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was the chief protagonist of all-India services in
the Constituent Assembly. Hence, he came to be regarded as the ‘Father of
all-India Services’.
Central Services
The personnel of Central services work under the exclusive jurisdiction of
the Central government. They hold specialised (functional and technical)
positions in various departments of the Central government.
Before Independence, the Central services were classified into class-I,
class-II, subordinate and inferior services. After Independence, the
nomenclature of subordinate and inferior services was replaced by class-III
and class-IV services. Again in 1974, the classification of Central services
into class-I, class-II, class-III and class-IV was changed to group A, group
B, group C and group D, respectively2
 .
At present, there are 62 group A Central services. Some of them are:
1.  Central Engineering Service.
2.  Central Health Service.
3.  Central Information Service.
4.  Central Legal Service.
5.  Central Secretariat Service.
6.  Indian Audit and Accounts Service.
7.  Indian Defence Accounts Service.
8.  Indian Economic Service.
9.  Indian Foreign Service.
10.  Indian Meteorological Service.
11.  Indian Postal Service.
12.  Indian Revenue Service (Customs, Excise and Income Tax)
13.  Indian Statistical Service.
14.  Overseas Communication Service.
15.  Railway Personnel Service.
Most of the above cadres of group A Central services have also
corresponding group B services. The group C Central services consists of
clerical personnel while group D consists of manual personnel. Thus group
A and group B comprises of gazetted officers while group C and group D
are non-gazetted.
Among all, the Indian Foreign Service (IFS) is the highest central service
in terms of prestige, status, pay and emoluments. In fact, it (though a central
service) competes with the all-India services in position, status and pay
scales. It comes next to the IAS in ranking and its pay scale is higher than
the IPS.
State Services
The personnel of state services work under the exclusive jurisdiction of the
state government. They hold different positions (general, functional and
technical) in the departments of the state government. However, they
occupy lower positions (in the administrative hierarchy of the state) than
those held by the members of the all-India services (IAS, IPS and IFS).
The number of services in a state differ from state to state. The services
that are common to all the states are:
1.  Civil Service.
2.  Police Service.
3.  Forest Service.
4.  Agricultural Service.
5.  Medical Service.
6.  Veterinary Service.
7.  Fisheries Service.
8.  Judicial Service.
9.  Public Health Service.
10.  Educational Service.
11.  Co-operative Service.
12.  Registration Service.
13.  Sales Tax Service.
14.  Jail Service.
15.  Service of Engineers.
Each of these services is named after the state, that is, name of the state is
added as a prefix. For example, in Andhra Pradesh (AP), they are known as
AP Civil Service, AP Police Service, AP Forest Service, AP Agricultural
Service, AP Medical Service, AP Veterinary Service, AP Fisheries Service,
AP Judicial Service, and so on. Among all the state services, the civil
service (also known as the administrative service) is the most prestigious.
Like the Central services, the state services are also classified into four
categories: class I (group I or group A), class II (group II or group B), class
III (group III or group C) and class IV (group IV or group D).
Further, the state services are also classified into gazetted class and nongazetted class. Usually, Class I (Group-A) and Class-II (Group-B) Services
are gazetted classes while Class-III (Group-C) and Class-IV (Group-D)
services are non-gazetted classes. The names of the members of gazetted
class are published in the Government Gazette for appointment, transfer,
promotion and retirement, while those of the non-gazetted are not
published. Further, the members of the gazetted class enjoy some privileges
which are denied to the members of non-gazetted class. Also, the members
of the gazetted class are called ‘officers’ while those of non-gazetted are
called ‘employees’.
The All-India Services Act of 1951 specifies that senior posts not
exceeding thirty-three and one third per cent in the Indian Administrative
Service (IAS), Indian Police Service (IPS) and Indian Forest Service (IFS)
are required to be filled in by promotion of officers employed in the state
services. Such promotions are made on the recommendation of selection
committee constituted for this purpose in each state. Such a committee is
presided over by the Chairman or a member of UPSC.
CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS
Articles 308 to 314 in part XIV of the Constitution contain provisions with
regard to all-India services, Central services and state services.
1. Recruitment and Service Conditions
Article 309 empowers the Parliament and the state legislatures to regulate
the recruitment and the conditions of service of the persons appointed to
public services and posts under the Centre and the states, respectively. Until
such laws are made, the president or the governor can make rules to
regulate these matters.
Recruitment includes any method provided for inducting a person in
public service like appointment, selection, deputation, promotion and
appointment by transfer.
The conditions of service of a public servant includes pay, allowances,
periodical increments, leave, promotion, tenure or termination of service,
transfer, deputation, various types of rights, disciplinary action, holidays,
hours of work and retirement benefits like pension, provident fund, gratuity
and so on.
Under this provision, the Parliament or the state legislature can impose
‘reasonable’ restrictions on the Fundamental Rights of public servants in
the interests of integrity, honesty, efficiency, discipline, impartiality,
secrecy, neutrality, anonymity, devotion to duty and so on. Such restrictions
are mentioned in the conduct rules like Central Services (Conduct) Rules,
Railway Services (Conduct) Rules and so on.
2. Tenure of Office
According to Article 310, members of the defence services, the civil
services of the Centre and the all-India services or persons holding military
posts or civil posts3 under the Centre, hold office during the pleasure of the
president. Similarly, members of the civil services of a state or persons
holding civil posts under a state, hold office during the pleasure of the
governor of the state.
However, there is an exception to this general rule of dismissal at
pleasure. The president or the governor may (in order to secure the services
of a person having special qualifications) provide for the payment of
compensation to him in two cases: (i) if the post is abolished before the
expiration of the contractual period, or (ii) if he is required to vacate that
post for reasons not connected with misconduct on his part. Notably, such a
contract can be made only with a new entrant, that is, a person who is not
already a member of a defence service, a civil service of the Centre, an allIndia service or a civil service of a state.
3. Safeguards to Civil Servants
Article 311 places two restrictions on the above ‘doctrine of pleasure’. In
other words, it provides two safeguards to civil servants against any
arbitrary dismissal from their posts:
(a)  A civil servant cannot be dismissed or removed4 by an authority
subordinate to that by which he was appointed.
(b)  A civil servant cannot be dismissed or removed or reduced in rank5
except after an inquiry in which he has been informed of the charges
against him and given a reasonable opportunity of being heard in
respect of those charges.
The above two safeguards are available only to the members of the civil
services of the Centre, the all-India services, the civil services of a state or
to persons holding civil posts under the Centre or a state and not to the
members of defence services or persons holding military posts.
However, the second safeguard (holding inquiry) is not available in the
following three cases:
(a)  Where a civil servant is dismissed or removed or reduced in rank
on the ground of conduct which has led to his conviction on a criminal
charge; or
(b)  Where the authority empowered to dismiss or remove a civil
servant or to reduce him in rank is satisfied that for some reason (to be
recorded in writing), it is not reasonably practicable to hold such
inquiry; or
(c)  Where the president or the governor is satisfied that in the interest
of the security of the state, it is not expedient to hold such inquiry.
Originally, the opportunity of being heard was given to a civil servant at
two stages–at the inquiry stage, and at the punishment stage. But, the 42nd
Amendment Act of 1976 abolished the provision for second opportunity
(that is, the right of a civil servant to make representation against the
punishment proposed as a result of the findings of the inquiry). Hence, the
present position is that where it is proposed (after inquiry) to impose upon a
civil servant the punishment of dismissal, removal or reduction in rank, it
may be imposed on the basis of the evidence adduced at the inquiry without
giving him any opportunity of making representation on the penalty
proposed.
The Supreme Court held that the expression ‘reasonable opportunity of
being heard’ envisaged to a civil servant (in the second safeguard
mentioned above) includes:
(a)  an opportunity to deny his guilt and establish his innocence which
he can only do if he is told what the charges levelled against him are
and the allegations on which such charges are based;
(b)  an opportunity to defend himself by cross-examining the witnesses
produced against him and by examining himself or any other witnesses
in support of his defence; and
(c)  the disciplinary authority must supply a copy of the inquiry
officer’s report to the delinquent civil servant for observations and
comments before the disciplinary authority considers the report.
4. All-India Services
Article 312 makes the following provisions in respect of all-India services:
(a)  The Parliament can create new allIndia services (including an allIndia judicial service), if the Rajya Sabha passes a resolution declaring
that it is necessary or expedient in the national interest to do so. Such a
resolution in the Rajya Sabha should be supported by two-thirds of the
members present and voting. This power of recommendation is given
to the Rajya Sabha to protect the interests of states in the Indian federal
system.
(b)  Parliament can regulate the recruitment and conditions of service
of persons appointed to all-India services. Accordingly, the Parliament
has enacted the All-India Services Act, 1951 for the purpose.
(c)  The services known at the commencement of the Constitution (that
is, January 26, 1950) as the Indian Administrative Service and the
Indian Police Service are deemed to be services created by Parliament
under this provision.
(d)  The all-India judicial service should not include any post inferior
to that of a district judge6
. A law providing for the creation of this
service is not to be deemed as an amendment of the Constitution for
the purposes of Article 368.
Though the 42nd Amendment Act of 1976 made the provision for the
creation of allIndia judicial service, no such law has been made so far.
5. Other Provisions
Article 312 A (inserted by the 28th Amendment Act of 1972) confers
powers on the Parliament to vary or revoke the conditions of service of
persons who were appointed to a civil service of the Crown in India before
1950. Article 313 deals with transitional provisions and says that until
otherwise provided, all the laws in force before 1950 and applicable to any
public service would continue. Article 314 which made provision for
protection of existing officers of certain services was repealed by the 28th
Amendment Act of 1972.

NOTES AND REFERENCES
1.  In 1963, a provision was made for the creation of three more allIndia services. They were Indian Forest Service, Indian Medical and
Health Service and Indian Service of Engineers. However, out of these
three, only the Indian Forest Service came into existence in 1966.
2.  This was done on the recommendation of the Third Pay
Commission (1970–1973) while the earlier change was done on the
recommendation of the First Pay Commission (1946–1947).
3.  A ‘civil post’ means an appointment or office or employment on the
civil side of the administration as distinguished from the military side.
4.  The difference between dismissal and removal is that the former
disqualifies for future employment under the government while the
latter does not disqualify for future employment under the government.
5.  ‘Reduction in rank’ means reduction from a higher to a lower rank
or post. It is a penalty imposed on a civil servant.
6.  The expression ‘district judge’ includes judge of a city civil court,
additional district judge, joint district judge, assistant district judge,
chief judge of a small cause court, chief presidency magistrate,
additional chief presidency magistrate, sessions judge, additional
sessions judge and assistant sessions judge.
67 Rights and Liabilities of the
Government
Articles 294 to 300 in Part XII of the Constitution deal with the property,
contracts, rights, liabilities, obligations and suits of the Union and the states.
In this regard, the Constitution makes the Union or the states as juristic
(legal) persons.
PROPERTY OF THE UNION AND THE STATES
1. Succession
All property and assets that were vested in the Dominion of India or a
province or an Indian princely state, before the commencement of the
present Constitution, became vested in the Union or the corresponding
state.
Similarly, all rights, liabilities and obligations of the government of the
dominion of India or a province or an Indian state would now be the rights,
liabilities and obligations of the Government of India or the corresponding
state.
2. Escheat, Lapse and Bona Vacantia
Any property in India that would have accrued to King of England or ruler
of Indian state (princely) by escheat (death of a person inte-state without
any heir), lapse (termination of rights through disuse or failure to follow
appropriate procedures) or bona vacantia (property found without any
owner) for want of a rightful owner, would now vest in the state if the
property is situated there, and in the Union, in any other case. In all these
three cases, the property accrues to the government as there is no rightful
owner (claimant).
3. Sea-Wealth
All lands, minerals and other things of value under the waters of the ocean
within the territorial waters of India, the continental shelf of India and the
exclusive economic zone of India vests in the Union. Hence, a state near the
ocean cannot claim jurisdiction over these things.
India’s territorial waters extend to a distance of 12 nautical miles from
the appropriate base line. Similarly, India’s exclusive economic zone
extends upto 200 nautical miles1
 .
4. Compulsory Acquisition by Law
The Parliament as well as the state legislatures are empowered to make
laws for the compulsory acquisition and requisitioning of private property
by the governments. Further, the 44th Amendment Act (1978) has also
abolished the constitutional obligation to pay compensation in this regard
except in two cases: (a) when the government acquires the property of a
minority educational institution; and (b) when the government acquires the
land held by a person under his personal cultivation and the land is within
the statutory ceiling limits2
 .
5. Acquisition under Executive Power
The Union or a state can acquire, hold and dispose property under the
exercise of its executive power.
Further, the executive power of the Union or a state extends to the
carrying on any trade or business within and in other states also.
SUITS BY OR AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT
Article 300 of the Constitution deals with the suits by or against the
Government in India. It lays down that the Government of India may sue or
be sued by the name of the Union of India and government of a state may
sue or be sued by the name of that state, eg, State of Andhra Pradesh or
State of Uttar Pradesh and so on. Thus, the Union of India and states are
legal entities (juristic personalities) for purposes of suits and proceedings,
not the Government of the Union or government of states.
Regarding the extent of the governmental liability, the Constitution
(Article 300) declares that the Union of India or states can sue or be sued in
relation to their respective affairs in the like cases as the dominion of India
and the corresponding provinces or Indian states might have sued or been
sued before the Constitution. This provision is subject to any law made by
Parliament or a state legislature. But, no such law has been enacted so far.
Hence, at present, the position in this respect remains the same as it existed
before the Constitution. In the pre-Constitution period (i.e., from the days of
the East India Company up to the commencement of the Constitution in
1950), the government was suable for contracts but not for torts (wrongs
committed by its servants) in respect of its sovereign functions. This is
explained in detail as follows:
1. Liability for Contracts
Under the exercise of its executive power, the Union or a state can enter
into contracts for the acquisition, holding and disposal of property, or to
carry on any trade or business, or for any other purpose. But, the
Constitution lays down three conditions which must be fulfilled by such
contracts:
(a)  They must be expressed to be made by the president or governor,
as the case may be;
(b)  They must be executed on behalf of the president or governor, as
the case may be; and
(c)  They must be executed by such person or in such manner as the
president or governor may direct or authorise.
These conditions are mandatory and not merely directory in nature.
Failure to comply with them nullifies the contracts and renders them void
and unenforceable in the courts.
Further, the president or the governor is not personally liable in respect of
any contract executed in his name. Similarly, the officer executing the
contract is also not personally liable. This immunity is purely personal and
does not immunize the government from a contractual liability, making the
government suable in contracts. This means that the contractual liability of
the Union government and the state governments is the same as that of an
individual under the ordinary law of contract, which has been the position
in India since the days of the East India Company.
2. Liability for Torts
In the beginning, the East India Company was only a trading body.
Gradually, it acquired territories in India and became a sovereign authority.
The Company was suable for its functions as a trader but not as a sovereign.
This immunity of the Company in respect of its sovereign functions was
based on the English Common Law maxim that the ‘King can do no
wrong’, which means that the King was not liable for wrongs of his
servants. This traditional immunity of the State (i.e., Crown) in Britain from
any legal liability for any action has been done away by the Crown
Proceedings Act (1947). However, the position in India still remains the
same.
Therefore, the government (Union or states) in India can be sued for torts
(civil wrongs) committed by its officials only in the exercise of its nonsovereign functions but not in the sovereign functions like administering
justice, constructing a military road, commandeering goods during war, etc.
This distinction between the sovereign and nonsovereign functions of the
Government in India and the immunity of the government in respect of its
sovereign functions was established in the famous P and O Steam
Navigation Company case3
(1861). This was reaffirmed by the Supreme
Court in the post-independence era in the Kasturilal case4
(1965). However,
after this case, the Supreme Court started giving a restrictive interpretation
to sovereign functions of the government and awarded compensation to
victims in a large number of cases.
In Nagendra Rao Case4a
(1994), the Supreme Court criticised the doctrine
of sovereign immunity of the State and adopted a liberal approach with
respect to the tortuous liability of the State. It ruled that when a citizen
suffers any damage due to the negligent act of the servants of the State, the
State would be liable to pay compensation for it and the State cannot avoid
this liability on the ground of sovereign immunity. It held that in the
modern sense, the distinction between sovereign and non-sovereign
functions does not exist. It laid down the proposition that barring a few
functions, the State cannot claim any immunity. Its observations, in this
case, are as follows:
1.  No civilised system can permit an executive to play with the people
of its country and claim that it is entitled to act in any manner as it is
sovereign. The concept of public interest has changed with structural
change in the society. No legal or political system today can place the
State above law as it is unjust and unfair for a citizen to be deprived of
his property illegally by negligent act of officers of the State without
any remedy.
2.  The modern social thinking of progressive societies and the judicial
approach is to do away with archaic State protection and place the
State or the Government at par with any other juristic legal entity. Any
water-tight compartmen-talisation of the functions of the State as
“sovereign” and “non-sovereign” or “governmental” and “nongovernmental” is not sound. It is contrary to modern jurisprudential
thinking.
3.  The need of the State, duty of its officials and right of the citizens
are required to be reconciled so that the rule of law in a welfare State is
not shaken. In a welfare State, the functions of the State are not only
the defence of the country or administration of justice or maintaining
law and order but it extends to regulating and controlling the activities
of the people in almost every sphere–educational, commercial, social,
economic, political and even marital.
4.  The demarcating line between sovereign and non-sovereign powers
for which no rational basis survives has largely disappeared.
Therefore, barring functions such as administration of justice,
maintenance of law and order and repression of crime etc., which are
among the primary and inalienable functions of a constitutional
Government, the State cannot claim any immunity.
In the above case, the Supreme Court did not overrule its judgement in
the Kasturilal case (1965). However, it said that it is applicable to rare and
limited cases.
In Common Cause Case4b
(1999), the Supreme Court again examined the
whole doctrine and rejected the sovereign immunity rule. The Court held
that the rule of State liability as laid down in P. & O. Steam Navigation
Company case is very outmoded. It said that in modern times when the
State activities have been considerably increased it is very difficult to draw
a line between its sovereign and non-sovereign functions. The increased
activities of the State have made a deep impression on all facets of citizens’
life, and therefore, the liability of the State must be made co-extensive with
the modern concept of a welfare State. The State must be liable for all
tortuous acts of its employees, whether done in exercise of sovereign or
non-sovereign powers4c
. Finally, the court observed that the efficacy of
Kasturilal case as a binding precedent has been eroded.
In the Prisoner’s Murder case4d
(2000), the Supreme Court ruled that in
the process of judicial advancement Kasturilal case has paled into
insignificance and is no longer of any binding value.
SUITS AGAINST PUBLIC OFFICIALS
1. President and Governor
The Constitution confers certain immunities to the president of India and
governor of states with regard to their official acts and personal acts. These
are:
(a)  Official Acts
The president and the governors cannot be sued during the term of their
office or thereafter, for any act done by them in the exercise and
performance of their official powers and duties. However, the official
conduct of the president can be reviewed by a court, tribunal or any other
body authorised by either House of Parliament to investigate charges for
impeachment. Further, the aggrieved person can bring appropriate
proceedings against the Union of India instead of the president and the state
instead of the Governor of that state.
(b)  Personal Acts
No criminal proceedings can be started against the president and the
governors in respect of their personal acts nor can they be arrested or
imprisoned. This immunity is limited to the period of the term of their
office only and does not extend beyond that. However, civil proceedings
can be started against them during their term of office in respect of their
personal acts after giving two months’ advance notice.
2. Ministers
The Constitution does not grant any immunity to the ministers for their
official acts. But, since they are not required to countersign (as in Britain)
the official acts of the president and the governors, they are not liable in the
courts for those acts5
. Moreover, they are not liable for the official acts done
by the president and the governors on their advice as the courts are debarred
from inquiring into such advice. However, the ministers do not enjoy any
immunity for their personal acts, and can be sued for crimes as well as torts
in the ordinary courts like common citizens.
3. Judicial Officers
The judicial officers enjoy immunity from any liability in respect of their
official acts and hence, cannot be sued. The Judicial Officers Protection Act
(1850) lays down that, ‘no judge, magistrate, justice of peace, collector or
other person acting judicially shall be liable to be sued in any civil court for
any act done by him in the discharge of his official duty’.
4. Civil Servants
Under the Constitution, the civil servants are conferred personal immunity
from legal liability for official contracts. This means that the civil servant
who made a contract in his official capacity is not personally liable in
respect of that contract but it is the government (Central or state) that is
liable for the contract. But, if the contract is made without complying the
conditions specified in the Constitution, then the civil servant who made the
contract is personally liable. Further, the civil servants also enjoy immunity
from legal liability for their tortious acts in respect of the sovereign
functions of the government. In other cases, the liability of the civil servants
for torts or illegal acts is the same as of any ordinary citizen. Civil
proceedings can be instituted against them for anything done in their
official capacity after giving a two months’ advance notice. But, no such
notice is required when the action is to be brought against them for the acts
done outside the scope of their official duties. Criminal proceedings can be
instituted against them for acts done in their official capacity, with the prior
permission of the president or the governor, where necessary6

68 Special Provisions Relating to
Certain Classes
RATIONALE OF SPECIAL PROVISIONS
In order to realise the objectives of equality and justice as laid down in the
Preamble, the Constitution makes special provisions for the scheduled
castes (SCs), the scheduled tribes (STs), the backward classes (BCs) and the
Anglo-Indians. These special provisions are contained in Part XVI of the
Constitution from Articles 330 to 342A. They are related to the following:
1.  Reservation in Legislatures
2.  Special Representation in Legislatures
3.  Reservation in Services and Posts
4.  Educational Grants
5.  Appointment of National Commissions
6.  Appointment of Commissions of Investigation
These special provisions can be classified into the following broad
categories:
(a)  Permanent and Temporary – Some of them are a permanent feature
of the Constitution, while some others continue to operate only for a
specified period.
(b)  Protective and Developmental – Some of them aim at protecting
these classes from all forms of injustice and exploitation, while some
others aim at promoting their socio-economic interests.
SPECIFICATION OF CLASSES
The Constitution does not specify the castes or tribes which are to be called
the SCs or the STs. It leaves to the President the power to specify as to what
castes or tribes in each state and union territory are to be treated as the SCs
and STs. Thus, the lists of the SCs or STs vary from state to state and union
territory to union territory. In case of the states, the President issues the
notification after consulting the governor of the state concerned. But, any
inclusion or exclusion of any caste or tribe from Presidential notification
can be done only by the Parliament and not by a subsequent Presidential
notification. Presidents have issued several orders specifying the SCs and
STs in different states and union territories and these have also been
amended by the Parliament.1
Similarly, the constitution has not specified the classes of citizens who
are to be called the socially and educationally backward classes, also known
as Other Backward Classes (OBCs). The 102nd Amendment Act of 2018
empowered the President to specify the socially and educationally
backward classes in relation to a state or union territory. In case of a state,
the President issues the notification after consultation with the governor of
the state concerned. But, any inclusion in or exclusion from the Central List
of socially and educationally backward classes specified in a Presidential
notification can be done only by the Parliament and not by a subsequent
Presidential notification2
 .
Unlike in the case of SCs, STs and OBCs, the Constitution has defined
the persons who belong to the Anglo-Indian community. Accordingly, ‘an
Anglo-Indian means a person whose father or any of whose other male
progenitors in the male line is or was of European descent but who is
domiciled within the territory of India and is or was born within such
territory of parents habitually resident therein and not established there for
temporary purposes only’.
COMPONENTS OF SPECIAL PROVISIONS
1.  Reservation for SCs and STs and Special Representation for
Anglo-Indians in Legislatures: Seats are to be reserved for the SCs
and STs in the Lok Sabha and the state legislative assemblies on the
basis of population ratios.
The President can nominate two members of the Anglo-Indian
community to the Lok Sabha, if the community is not adequately
represented. Similarly, the governor of a state can nominate one
member of the Anglo-Indian community to the state legislative
assembly, if the community is not adequately represented.
Originally, these two provisions of reservation and special
representation were to operate for ten years (i.e., up to 1960) only. But
this duration has been extended continuously since then by ten years
each time. Now, under the 95th Amendment Act of 2009, these two
provisions of reservation and special representation are to last until
2020.3
The reasons for the extension of the above two provisions of
reservation and special representation by the 95th Amendment Act of
2009 are as follows3a
:
(i)  Article 334 of the Constitution lays down that the provisions of the
Constitution relating to the reservation of seats for the Scheduled
Castes and the Scheduled Tribes and the representation of the AngloIndian community by nomination in the House of the People and the
Legislative Assemblies of the States shall cease to have effect on the
expiration of the period of sixty years from the commencement of the
Constitution. In other words, these provisions will cease to have effect
on the 25th
 January, 2010, if not extended further.
(ii) Although the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes have
made considerable progress in the last sixty years, the reasons which
weighed with the Constituent Assembly in making provisions with
regard to the aforesaid reservation of seats and nomination of members
have not ceased to exist. It is, therefore, proposed to continue the
reservation for the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes and the
representation of the Anglo-Indian community by nomination for a
further period of ten years.
The reason for this special representation to the Anglo-Indians is as
follows: “Anglo-Indians constitute a religious, social, as well as a
linguistic minority. These provisions were necessary, for, otherwise,
being numerically an extremely small community, and being
interspersed all over India, the Anglo-Indians could not hope to get
any seat in any legislature through election”.4
2.  Claims of SCs and STs to Services and Posts: The claims of the
SCs and STs are to be taken into consideration while making
appointments to the public services of the Centre and the states,
without sacrificing the efficiency of administration. However, the 82nd
Amendment Act of 2000 provides for making of any provision in
favour of the SCs and STs for relaxation in qualifying marks in any
examination or lowering the standards of evaluation, for reservation in
matters of promotion to the public services of the Centre and the states.
3.  Special Provision in Services and Educational Grants for AngloIndians: Before independence, certain posts were reserved for the
Anglo-Indians in the railway, customs, postal and telegraph services of
the Union. Similarly, the Anglo-Indian educational institutions were
given certain special grants by the Centre and the states. Both the
benefits were allowed to continue under the Constitution on a
progressive diminution basis and finally came to an end in 1960.
4.  National Commissions for SCs and STs: The President should set
up a National Commission for the SCs to investigate all matters
relating to the constitutional safeguards for the SCs and to report to
him (Article 338). Similarly, the President should also set up a
National Commission for the STs to investigate all matters relating to
the Constitutional safeguards for the STs and to report to him (Article
338-A). The President should place all such reports before the
Parliament, along with the action taken memorandum. Previously, the
Constitution provided for a combined National Commission for SCs
and STs. The 89th Amendment Act of 2003 bifurcated the combined
commission into two separate bodies.5
The National Commission for SCs is also required to discharge
similar functions with regard to the Anglo-Indian Community as it
does with respect to the SCs. In other words, the commission has to
investigate all matters relating to the Constitutional and other legal
safeguards for the Anglo-Indian community and report to the President
upon their working.6
5.  National Commission for BCs: The National Commission for BCs
was set-up in 1993 by an Act of Parliament. Later, the 102nd
Amendment Act of 2018 conferred a constitutional status on the
commission. For this purpose, the amendment inserted a new Article
338-B in the constitution. Accordingly, the President should set-up a
National Commission for the socially and educationally BCs to
investigate all matters relating to the constitutional safeguards for the
socially and educationally BCs and to report to him. The President
should place all such reports before the Parliament, along with the
action taken memorandum.
6.  Control of the Union over the Administration of Scheduled Areas
and the Welfare of STs: The President is required to appoint a
commission to report on the administration of the scheduled areas and
the welfare of the STs in the states. He can appoint such a commission
at any time but compulsorily after ten years of the commencement of
the Constitution. Hence, a commission was appointed in the year 1960.
It was headed by U.N. Dhebar and submitted its report in 1961. After
four decades, the second commission was appointed in 2002 under the
chairmanship of Dilip Singh Bhuria. It submitted its report in 2004.
Further, the executive power of the Centre extends to the giving of
directions to a state with respect to the drawing up and execution of
schemes for the welfare of the STs in the state.
7.  Appointment of a Commission to Investigate the Conditions of
BCs: The President may appoint a commission to investigate the
conditions of socially and educationally backward classes and to
recommend the steps to improve their condition. The report of the
commission is to be placed before the Parliament, along with action
taken memorandum. Under the above provision, the President has
appointed two commissions so far. The first backward classes
commission was appointed in 1953 under the chairmanship of Kaka
Kalelkar. It submitted its report in 1955. But, no action was taken on it
as the recommendations were considered to be too vague and
impractical and also there was a sharp division among the members on
the criterion of backwardness.
The second Backward Classes Commission was appointed in 1979
with B.P. Mandal as chairman. It submitted its report in 1980. Its
recommendations were also lying unattended till 1990 when the V.P.
Singh Government declared reservation of 27 percent government jobs
for the OBCs.7

69 Political Parties
MEANING AND TYPES
Political parties are voluntary associations or organised groups of
individuals who share the same political views and who try to gain political
power through constitutional means and who desire to work for promoting
the national interest. There are four types of political parties in the modern
democratic states, viz., (i) reactionary parties which cling to the old socioeconomic and political institutions; (ii) conservative parties which believe
in the status-quo; (iii) liberal parties which aim at reforming the existing
institutions; and (iv) radical parties which aim at establishing a new order
by overthrowing the existing institutions. In their classification of political
parties on the basis of ideologies, the political scientists have placed the
radical parties on the left and the liberal parties in the centre and reactionary
and conservative parties on the right. In other words, they are described as
the leftist parties, centrist parties and the rightist parties. In India, the CPI
and CPM are the examples of leftist parties, the Congress of centrist parties
and the BJP is an example of rightist parties.
There are three kinds of party systems in the world, viz., (i) one party
system in which only one ruling party exists and no opposition is permitted,
as for example, in the former communist countries like the USSR and other
East European countries; (ii) two-party system in which two major parties
exists, as for example, in USA and Britain1
; and (iii) multi-party system in
which there are a number of political parties leading to the formation of
coalition governments, as for example, in France, Switzerland and Italy.
PARTY SYSTEM IN INDIA
The Indian party system has the following characteristic features:
Multi-Party System
The continental size of the country, the diversified character of Indian
society, the adoption of universal adult franchise, the peculiar type of
political process, and other factors have given rise to a large number of
political parties. In fact, India has the largest number of political parties in
the world. On the eve of seventeenth Lok Sabha general elections (2019),
there were 7 national parties, 52 state parties and 2354 registered -
unrecognised parties in the country2
. Further, India has all categories of
parties–left parties, centrist parties, right parties, communal parties, noncommunal parties and so on. Consequently, the hung Parliaments, hung
assemblies and coalition governments have become a common phenomena.
One-Dominant Party System
In spite of the multiparty system, the political scene in India was dominated
for a long period by the Congress. Hence, Rajni Kothari, an eminent
political analyst, preferred to call the Indian party system as ‘one party
dominance system’ or the ‘Congress system’3
. The dominant position
enjoyed by the Congress has been declining since 1967 with the rise of
regional parties and other national parties like Janata (1977), Janata Dal
(1989) and the BJP (1991) leading to the development of a competitive
multi-party system.
Lack of Clear Ideology
Except the BJP and the two communist parties (CPI and CPM), all other
parties do not have a clear-cut ideology. They (i.e., all other parties) are
ideologically closer to each other. They have a close resemblance in their
policies and programmes. Almost every party advocates democracy,
secularism, socialism and Gandhism. More than this, every party, including
the so-called ideological parties, is guided by only one consideration–power
capture. Thus, politics has become issuebased rather than the ideology and
pragmatism has replaced the commitment to the principles.
Personality Cult
Quite often, the parties are organised around an eminent leader who
becomes more important than the party and its ideology. Parties are known
by their leaders rather than by their manifesto. It is a fact that the popularity
of the Congress was mainly due to the leadership of Nehru, Indira Gandhi
and Rajiv Gandhi. Similarly, the AIADMK in Tamil Nadu and TDP in
Andhra Pradesh got identified with MG Ramachandran and NT Rama Rao
respectively. Interestingly, several parties bear the name of their leader like
Biju Janata Dal, Lok Dal (A), Congress (I) and so on. Hence, it is said that
“there are political personalities rather than political parties in India”.
Based on Traditional Factors
In the western countries, the political parties are formed on the basis of
socio-economic and political programme. On the other hand, a large
number of parties in India are formed on the basis of religion, caste,
language, culture, race and so on. For example, Shiv Sena, Muslim League,
Hindu Maha Sabha, Akali Dal, Muslim Majlis, Bahujan Samaj Party,
Republican Party of India, Gorkha League and so on. These parties work
for the promotion of communal and sectional interests and thereby
undermine the general public interest.
Emergence of Regional Parties
Another significant feature of the Indian party system is the emergence of a
large number of regional parties and their growing role. They have become
the ruling parties in various states like BJD in Orissa, DMK or AIADMK in
Tamil Nadu, Akali Dal in Punjab, AGP in Assam, National Conference in
J&K, JD(U) in Bihar and so on. In the beginning, they were confined to the
regional politics only. But, of late, they have come to play a significant role
in the national politics due to coalition governments at the Centre. In the
1984 elections, the TDP emerged as the largest opposition party in the Lok
Sabha.
Factions and Defections
Factionalism, defections, splits, mergers, fragmentation, polarisation and so
on have been an important aspect of the functioning of political parties in
India. Lust for power and material considerations have made the politicians
to leave their party and join another party or start a new party. The practice
of defections gained greater currency after the fourth general elections
(1967). This phenomenon caused political instability both at the Centre and
in the states and led to disintegration of the parties. Thus, there are two
Janata Dals, two TDPs, two DMKs, two Communist Parties, two Congress,
three Akali Dals, three Muslim Leagues and so on.
Lack of Effective Opposition
An effective Opposition is very essential for the successful operation of the
parliamentary democracy prevalent in India. It checks the autocratic
tendencies of the ruling party and provides an alternative government.
However, in the last 50 years, an effective, strong, organised and viable
national Opposition could never emerge except in flashes. The Opposition
parties have no unity and very often adopt mutually conflicting positions
with respect to the ruling party. They have failed to play a constructive role
in the functioning of the body politic and in the process of nation building.
RECOGNITION OF NATIONAL AND STATE PARTIES
The Election Commission registers political parties for the purpose of
elections and grants them recognition as national or state parties on the
basis of their poll performance. The other parties are simply declared as
registered-unrecognised parties.
The recognition granted by the Commission to the parties determines
their right to certain privileges like allocation of the party symbols,
provision of time for political broadcasts on the state-owned television and
radio stations and access to electoral rolls.
Further, the recognized parties need only one proposer for filing the
nomination. Also, these parties are allowed to have forty “star
campaigners” during the time of elections and the registered-unrecognized
parties are allowed to have twenty “star campaigners”. The travel expenses
of these star campaigners are not included in the election expenditure of the
candidates of their parties.
Every national party is allotted a symbol exclusively reserved for its use
throughout the country. Similarly, every state party is allotted a symbol
exclusively reserved for its use in the state or states in which it is so
recognised. A registered-unrecognised party, on the other hand, can select a
symbol from a list of free symbols. In other words, the Commission
specifies certain symbols as ‘reserved symbols’ which are meant for the
candidates set up by the recognised parties and others as ‘free symbols’
which are meant for other candidates.
Conditions for Recognition as a National Party
At present (2019), a party is recognised as a national party if any of the
following conditions is fulfilled4
 :
1.  If it secures six per cent of valid votes polled in any four or more
states at a general election to the Lok Sabha or to the legislative
assembly; and, in addition, it wins four seats in the Lok Sabha from
any state or states; or
2.  If it wins two per cent of seats in the Lok Sabha at a general
election; and these candidates are elected from three states; or
3.  If it is recognised as a state party in four states.
Conditions for Recognition as a State Party
At present (2019), a party is recognised as a state party in a state if any of
the following conditions is fulfilled5
 :
1.  If it secures six per cent of the valid votes polled in the state at a
general election to the legislative assembly of the state concerned; and,
in addition, it wins 2 seats in the assembly of the state concerned; or
2.  If it secures six per cent of the valid votes polled in the state at a
general election to the Lok Sabha from the state concerned; and, in
addition, it wins 1 seat in the Lok Sabha from the state concerned; or
3.  If it wins three per cent of seats in the legislative assembly at a
general election to the legislative assembly of the state concerned or 3
seats in the assembly, whichever is more; or
4.  If it wins 1 seat in the Lok Sabha for every 25 seats or any fraction
thereof allotted to the state at a general election to the Lok Sabha from
the state concerned; or
5.  If it secures eight per cent of the total valid votes polled in the state
at a General Election to the Lok Sabha from the state or to the
legislative assembly of the state. This condition was added in 2011.
The number of recognised parties keeps on changing on the basis of their
performance in the general elections. On the eve of the seventeenth Lok
Sabha general elections (2019), there were 7 national parties, 52 state
parties and 2354 registered-unrecognised parties in the country6
. The
national parties and state parties are also known as all-India parties and
regional parties respectively.

70 Role of Regional Parties
The presence of a large number of regional parties is an important feature
of the Indian Political System. They have come to play a vital role in Indian
politics at all levels, i.e. local, state and national. This is more so in the
context of the new era of coalition politics.
FEATURES OF REGIONAL PARTIES
Following are the features of a regional party:
1.  It generally operates within a particular state or specific region. Its
electoral base is limited to a single region.
2.  It articulates regional interests and identifies itself with a particular
cultural, religious, linguistic or ethnic group.
3.  It is primarily concerned with exploiting the local resources of
discontent or preserving a variety of primordial demands based on
language, caste or community or region1
 .
4.  It focuses on local or regional issues and aims to capture political
power at the state level. It has no inclination to expand and control the
central government.
5.  It has a political desire for greater regional autonomy of states in
the Indian Union2
 .
CLASSIFICATION OF REGIONAL PARTIES
The various regional parties in India can be classified into the following
four categories:
1.  Those regional parties which are based on the regional culture or
ethnicity. These include Shiromani Akali Dal, National Conference,
DMK, AIADMK, Telugu Desam, Shiv Sena, Asom Gana Parishad,
Mizo National Front, Jharkhand Mukti Morcha and so on.
2.  Those regional parties which have an all-India outlook but lack a
national electoral base. The examples are Indian National Lok Dal,
All-India Forward Bloc, Revolutionary Socialist Party, Samajwadi
Party, Nationalist Congress Party and so on.
3.  Those regional parties which have been formed by a split in
national parties. For example, Bangla Congress, Bharatiya Kranti Dal,
Utkal Congress, Kerala Congress, Telangana Praja Samithi, Biju
Janata Dal, Rashtriya Janata Dal, Janata Party, Samajwadi Janata Party,
Samata Party, Trinamool Congress, YSR Congress and so on.
4.  Those regional parties which have been formed by individual
leaders on the basis of their charismatic personality. These are called as
personalised parties and they are short-lived. The examples are Lok
Janshakti Party, Haryana Vikas Party, Himachal Vikas Congress,
Congress (J) and so on.
RISE OF REGIONAL PARTIES
There are multiple reasons for the emergence of regional parties in India.
These are as follows:
1.  Cultural and ethnic pluralism of the Indian society.
2.  Economic disparities and regional imbalances in the development.
3.  Desire of certain sections or areas to maintain separate identity due
to historical factors.
4.  Self-interest of the deposed Maharajas and dispossessed Zamindars.
5.  Failure of national politics to meet the regional aspirations.
6.  Reorganisation of states on the basis of language.
7.  Charismatic personality of the regional leaders.
8.  Factional fights within the larger parties.
9.  Centralising tendencies of the congress party.
10.  Absence of a strong opposition party at the central level.
11.  Role of caste and religion in the political process.
12.  Alienation and discontentment among the tribal groups.
ROLE OF REGIONAL PARTIES
The following points highlight the role played by the regional parties in
Indian politics:
1.  They have provided better governance and a stable government at
the regional level.
2.  They have posed a challenge to the one-party dominant system in
the country and led to a decline in the domination of the Congress
party3
 .
3.  They have made a strong impact on the nature and course of centrestate relations. The tension areas in centre-state relations and the
demand for grant of greater autonomy made the central leadership
more responsive to the needs of the regional actors4
 .
4.  They have made politics more competitive and popular
participation in the political process more extensive at the grass roots5
 .
5.  They have widened the choice for voters in both the parliamentary
and assembly elections. The voters can vote for that party which aims
to promote the interest of their state/region.
6.  They have increased the political consciousness of the people and
also their interest in politics. They bring into focus the local or regional
issues which immediately attract the attention of the masses.
7.  They provided a check against the dictatorial tendencies of the
central government. They opposed the ruling congress party at the
centre on certain issues and forced the dominant party to be more
reasonable in its approach to the process of conflict resolution6
 .
8.  They have made a significant contribution for the successful
functioning of parliamentary democracy. In a parliamentary
democracy, the minority must have its say, the majority must have its
way, and the regional parties have played this role successfully by
being ruling parties in some states and opposition parties at the centre7
.
9.  The have succeeded in exposing the partisan role of the Governors
in the appointment and dismissal of the Chief Minister, in issuing of
ordinances and reservation of bills for the consideration of the
President8
 .
10.  After the dawn of the era of coalition politics, the regional parties
have assumed an important role in national politics. The have joined
the coalition governments formed at the centre and shared power with
the national parties9
 .
DYSFUNCTIONS OF REGIONAL PARTIES
However, there are also negative points in the role of regional parties. These
are as follows:
1.  They have given more importance to regional interests rather than
national interests. They have neglected the implications and
consequences of their narrow approach to the resolution of national
issues.
2.  They have encouraged regionalism, cas-teism, linguism,
communalism and tribalism which have become hurdles to national
integration.
3.  They are responsible for the unresolution of the inter-state water
disputes, inter-state border disputes and other inter-state issues.
4.  They have also indulged in corruption, nepotism, favouritism and
other forms of misutilisation of power in order to promote their selfinterest.
5.  They have focused more on the populist schemes and measures to
expand and strengthen their electoral base. This has adversely affected
the state economy and development.
6.  They bring in regional factor in the decision-making and the policymaking by the coalition government at the centre. They force the
central leadership to yield to their demands10

71 Elections
ELECTORAL SYSTEM
Articles 324 to 329 in Part XV of the Constitution make the following
provisions with regard to the electoral system in our country:
1.  The Constitution (Article 324) provides for an independent Election
Commission in order to ensure free and fair elections in the country.
The power of superintendence, direction and conduct of elections to
the Parliament, the state legislatures, the office of the President and the
office of the VicePresident is vested in the Commission1
. At present,
the commission consists of a chief election commissioner and two
election commissioners2
 .
2.  There is to be only one general electoral roll for every territorial
constituency for election to the Parliament and the state legislatures.
Thus, the Constitution has abolished the system of communal
representation and separate electorates which led to the partition of the
country.
3.  No person is to be ineligible for inclusion in the electoral roll on
grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex or any of them. Further, no
person can claim to be included in any special electoral roll for any
constituency on grounds only of religion, race, caste or sex or any of
them. Thus, the Constitution has accorded equality to every citizen in
the matter of electoral franchise.
4.  The elections to the Lok Sabha and the state assemblies are to be on
the basis of adult franchise. Thus, every person who is a citizen of
India and who is 183 years of age, is entitled to vote at the election
provided he is not disqualified under the provisions of the Constitution
or any law made by the appropriate legislature (Parliament or state
legislature) on the ground of non-residence, unsound mind, crime or
corrupt or illegal practice4
 .
5.  Parliament may make provision with respect to all matters relating
to elections to the Parliament and the state legislatures including the
preparation of electoral rolls, the delimitation of constituencies and all
other matters necessary for securing their due constitution.
6.  The state legislatures can also make provision with respect to all
matters relating to elections to the state legislatures including the
preparation of electoral rolls and all other matters necessary for
securing their due constitution. But, they can make provision for only
those matters which are not covered by the Parliament. In other words,
they can only supplement the parliamentary law and cannot override it.
7.  The Constitution declares that the validity of any law relating to the
delimitation of constituencies or the allotment of seats to such
constituencies cannot be questioned in any court. Consequently, the
orders issued by the Delimitation Commission become final and
cannot be challenged in any court.
8.  The Constitution lays down that no election to the Parliament or the
state legislature is to be questioned except by an election petition
presented to such authority and in such manner as provided by the
appropriate legislature. Since 1966, the election petitions are triable by
high courts alone. But, the appellate jurisdiction lies with the Supreme
Court alone.
Article 323B empowers the appropriate legislature (Parliament or state
legislature) to establish a tribunal for the adjudication of election disputes.
It also provides for the exclusion of the jurisdiction of all courts (except the
special leave appeal jurisdiction of the Supreme Court) in such disputes. So
far, no such tribunal has been established. It must be noted here that in
Chandra Kumar case5
(1997), the Supreme Court declared this provision as
unconstitutional. Consequently, if at any time an election tribunal is
established, an appeal from its decision lies to the high court.
ELECTION MACHINERY
Election Commission of India (ECI)
Under Article 324 of the Constitution of India, the Election Commission of
India is vested with the power of superintendence, direction and control of
conducting the elections to the Lok Sabha and State Legislative Assemblies.
The Election Commission of India is a three-member body, with one Chief
Election Commissioner and two Election Commissioners. The President of
India appoints the Chief Election Commissioner and the Election
Commissioners.
Chief Electoral Officer (CEO)
The Chief Electoral Officer of a state/ Union Territory is authorised to
supervise the election work in the state/Union Territory subject to the
overall superintendence, direction and control of the Election Commission.
The Election Commission of India nominates or designates an Officer of
the Government of the state / Union Territory as the Chief Electoral Officer
in consultation with that State Government / Union Territory
Administration.
District Election Officer (DEO)
Subject to the superintendence, direction and control of the Chief Electoral
Officer, the District Election Officer supervises the election work of a
district. The Election Commission of India nominates or designates an
officer of the state Government as the District Election Officer in
consultation with the state government.
Returning Officer (RO)
The Returning Officer of a Parliamentary or assembly constituency is
responsible for the conduct of elections in the Parliamentary or assembly
constituency concerned. The Election Commission of India nominates or
designates an officer of the Government or a local authority as the
Returning Officer for each of the assembly and parliamentary
constituencies in consultation with the State Government / Union Territory
Administration. In addition, the Election Commission of India also appoints
one or more Assistant Returning Officers for each of the assembly and
Parliamentary constituencies to assist the Returning Officer in the
performance of his functions in connection with the conduct of elections.
Electoral Registration Officer (ERO)
The Electoral Registration Officer is responsible for the preparation of
electoral rolls for a Parliamentary / assembly constituency. The Election
Commission of India, in consultation with the state / UT government,
appoints an officer of the government or the local authorities as the
Electoral Registration Officer. In addition, the Election Commission of
India also appoints one or more Assistant Electoral Registration Officers to
assist the Electoral Registration Officer in the performance of his functions
in the matter of preparation / revision of electoral rolls.
Presiding Officer
The Presiding Officer with the assistance of polling officers conducts the
poll at a polling station. The District Election Officer appoints the Presiding
Officers and the Polling Officers. In the case of Union Territories, such
appointments are made by the Returning Officers.
Observers
The Election Commission of India nominates officers of Government as
Observers for Parliamentary and Assembly Constituencies. These observers
are of various kinds6
 :
1.  General Observers: The Commission deploys General Observers
in adequate number to ensure smooth conduct of elections. These
Observers are asked to keep a close watch on every stage of the
electoral process to ensure free and fair elections.
2.  Expenditure Observers: Expenditure Observers from Central
Government Services are appointed to keep a close watch on election
expenditure of the candidates and to ensure that no inducement is
offered to the electors during the entire election process for exercise of
their franchise.
3.  Police Observers: The Commission deploys IPS officers as Police
Observers at State and District levels, depending upon the sensitivity
of the Constituency, wherever required. They monitors all activities
relating to force deployment, law and order situation and co-ordinate
between the Civil and Police administration to ensure free and fair
election.
4.  Awareness Observers: For the first time in the 16th Lok Sabha
Elections (2014), the Commission deployed Central Awareness
Observers to oversee the efficient and effective management of the
electoral process at the field level, mainly in respect of voter
awareness and facilitation. Awareness Observers are deployed to
observe the interventions undertaken by the election machinery to
bridge the gap in people’s participation in the electoral process
particularly in regard to voters’ turnout. They also monitors the various
media related aspects of RP Act 1951 and observe the mechanism
directed by the Commission at District levels on checking the problem
of ‘Paid News’.
5.  Micro Observers: In addition to General Observers, the
Commission also deploys Micro Observers to observe the poll
proceedings on the poll day in selected critical polling stations. They
are chosen from Central Government / Central PSUs officials. MicroObservers verify the BMF at the Polling stations and certify the same
before start of polling. They observe the proceedings at the Polling
Stations on the poll day right from the mock poll to the completion of
poll and the process of sealing of EVMs and other documents to
ensure that all instructions of the Commission are complied with by
the Polling Parties and the Polling Agents. They also report to the
General Observers directly about vitiation of the poll proceedings, if
any, in their allotted Polling Stations.
6.  Assistant Expenditure Observers: In addition to Expenditure
Observers, Assistant Expenditure Observers are appointed for each
Assembly segment to ensure that all major election campaign events
are videographed and complaints of electoral malpractices are
promptly attended.
ELECTION PROCESS7
Time of Elections
Elections for the Lok Sabha and every state Legislative Assembly have to
take place every five years, unless called earlier. The President can dissolve
Lok Sabha and call a General Election before five years is up, if the
Government can no longer command the confidence of the Lok Sabha, and
if there is no alternative government available to take over.
Schedule of Elections
When the five-year limit is up, or the legislature has been dissolved and
new elections have been called, the Election Commission puts into effect
the machinery for holding an election. The Constitution states that there can
be no longer than six months between the last session of the dissolved Lok
Sabha and the recalling of the new House, so elections have to be
concluded before then.
The Commission normally announces the schedule of elections in a
major press conference a few weeks before the formal process is set in
motion. The Model Code of Conduct for guidance of candidates and
political parties comes immediately into effect after such announcement.
The formal process for the elections starts with the Notification or
Notifications calling upon the electorate to elect Members of a House. As
soon as Notifications are issued, candidates can start filing their
nominations in the constituencies from where they wish to contest. These
are scrutinised by the Returning Officer of the constituency concerned after
the last date for the same is over after about a week. The validly nominated
candidates can withdraw from the contest within two days from the date of
scrutiny. Contesting candidates get at least two weeks for political
campaign before the actual date of poll.
On account of the vast magnitude of operations and the massive size of
the electorate, polling is held on a number of days for the national elections.
A separate date for counting is fixed and the results declared for each
constituency by the concerned Returning Officer.
The Commission compiles the complete list of members elected and
issues an appropriate Notification for the due constitution of the House.
With this, the process of elections is complete and the President, in case of
the Lok Sabha, and the Governors of the concerned states, in case of State
Assemblies, can then convene their respective Houses to hold their
sessions.
Oath or Affirmation
It is necessary for a candidate to make and subscribe an oath or affirmation
before an officer authorised by the Election Commission. For any particular
election, the authorised persons are, principally, the Returning Officer and
the Assistant Returning Officer for the constituency. In the case of a
candidate confined in a prison or under preventive detention, the
superintendent of the prison or commandant of the detention camp in which
he is so confined or is under such detention is authorised to administer the
oath. And in the case of a candidate confined to bed in a hospital or
elsewhere owing to illness or any other cause, the medical superintendent in
charge of the hospital or the medical practitioner attending on him is
similarly authorised. If a candidate is outside India, the Indian Ambassador
or High Commissioner or diplomatic consular authorised by him can also
administer oath/affirmation. The candidate, in person, is required to make
the oath or affirmation immediately after presenting his nomination papers
and in any case not later than the day previous to the date of the scrutiny8
 .
Election Campaign
The campaign is the period when the political parties put forward their
candidates and arguments with which they hope to persuade people to vote
for their candidates and parties. Candidates are given a week to put forward
their nominations. These are scrutinised by the Returning Officers and if not
found to be in order can be rejected after a summary hearing. Validly
nominated candidates can withdraw within two days after nominations have
been scrutinised. The official campaign lasts at least two weeks from the
drawing up of the list of nominated candidates, and officially ends 48 hours
before polling closes.
During the election campaign, the political parties and contesting
candidates are expected to abide by a Model Code of Conduct evolved by
the Election Commission on the basis of a consensus among political
parties. The model code lays down broad guidelines as to how the political
parties and candidates should conduct themselves during the election
campaign. It is intended to maintain the election campaign on healthy lines,
avoid clashes and conflicts between political parties or their supporters and
to ensure peace and order during the campaign period and thereafter, until
the results are declared. The model code also prescribes guidelines for the
ruling party either at the Centre or in the state to ensure that a level field is
maintained and that no cause is given for any complaint that the ruling party
has used its official position for the purposes of its election campaign9
 .
Once an election has been called, parties issue manifestos detailing the
programmes they wish to implement if elected to government, the strengths
of their leaders, and the failures of opposing parties and their leaders.
Slogans are used to popularise and identify parties and issues, and
pamphlets and posters distributed to the electorate. Rallies and meetings
where the candidates try to persuade, cajole and enthuse supporters, and
denigrate opponents, are held throughout the constituencies. Personal
appeals and promises of reform are made, with candidates travelling the
length and breadth of the constituency to try to influence as many potential
supporters as possible.
Polling Days
Polling is normally held on a number of different days in different
constituencies, to enable the security forces and those monitoring the
election to keep law and order and ensure that voting during the election is
fair.
Ballot Papers and Symbols
After nomination of candidates is complete, a list of competing candidates
is prepared by the Returning Officer, and ballot papers are printed. Ballot
papers are printed with the names of the candidates (in languages set by the
Election Commission) and the symbols allotted to each of the candidates.
Candidates of recognised parties are allotted their party symbols.
Voting Procedure
Voting is by secret ballot. Polling stations are usually set up in public
institutions, such as schools and community halls. To enable as many
electors as possible to vote, the officials of the Election Commission try to
ensure that there is a polling station within two kilometres of every voter,
and that no polling stations should have to deal with more than 1500 voters.
Each polling station is open for at least eight hours on the day of the
election.
On entering the polling station, the elector is checked against the
electoral roll10
, and allocated a ballot paper. The elector votes by marking
the ballot paper with a rubber stamp on or near the symbol of the candidate
of his choice, inside a screened compartment in the polling station. The
voter then folds the ballot paper and inserts it in a common ballot box
which is kept in full view of the Presiding Officer and polling agents of the
candidates. This marking system eliminates the possibility of ballot papers
being surreptitiously taken out of the polling station or not being put in the
ballot box.
Since 1998, the Commission has increasingly used Electronic Voting
Machines (EMVs) instead of ballot boxes. In 2003, all state elections and
by elections were held using EVMs. Encouraged by this, the Commission
took a historic decision to use only EVMs for the Lok Sabha election in
2004. More than 1 million EVMs were used in this election.
Electronic Voting Machine
An Electronic Voting Machine (EVM) is a simple electronic device used to
record votes in place of ballot papers and boxes which were used earlier in
conventional voting system. The advantages of the EVM over the
traditional ballot paper / ballot box system are given here:
(i) It eliminates the possibility of invalid and doubtful votes which,
in many cases, are the root causes of controversies and election
petitions.
(ii) It makes the process of counting of votes much faster than the
conventional system.
(iii) It reduces to a great extent the quantity of paper used thus saving
a large number of trees making the process eco-friendly.
(iv) It reduces cost of printing (almost nil) as only one sheet of ballot
paper is required for each Polling Station11
 .
Supervising Elections
The Election Commission appoints a large number of Observers to ensure
that the campaign is conducted fairly, and that people are free to vote as
they choose. Election expenditure Observers keeps a check on the amount
that each candidate and party spends on the election.
Counting of Votes
After the polling has finished, the votes are counted under the supervision
of Returning Officers and Observers appointed by the Election
Commission. After the counting of votes is over, the Returning Officer
declares the name of the candidate, to whom the largest number of votes
have been given, as the winner and as having been returned by the
constituency to the concerned House.
Elections to the Lok Sabha are carried out using a first-past-the-post
electoral system. The country is split up into separate geographical areas,
known as constituencies, and the electors can cast one vote each for a
candidate, the winner being the candidate who gets the maximum votes.
Elections to the State Assemblies are carried out in the same manner as
for the Lok Sabha election, with the states and union territories divided into
single-member constituencies, and the first-past-the-post electoral system
used.
Media Coverage
In order to bring as much transparency as possible to the electoral process,
the media are encouraged and provided with facilities to cover the election,
although subject to maintaining the secrecy of the vote. Media persons are
given special passes to enter polling stations to cover the poll process and
the counting halls during the actual counting of votes.
Election Petitions
Any elector or candidate can file an election petition if he or she thinks
there has been malpractice during the election. An election petition is not an
ordinary civil suit, but treated as a contest in which the whole constituency
is involved. Election petitions are tried by the High Court of the state
involved, and if upheld can even lead to the restaging of the election in that
constituency.

also certain principles to be followed in allocating seats in the House of
People among the States and in the State Legislative Assemblies, but have
left the actual allocation of such seats to be provided by the law.
Similarly, Article 171 of the Constitution of India lays down the
maximum and minimum number of seats in the Legislative Council of a
State, and also specify the various methods in which the seats shall be
filled, but the actual number of seats to be filled by each such method has
been left to be provided by law.
Therefore, the Representation of the People Act, 1950, was enacted to
provide for the allocation of seats in the House of the People and in the
Legislative Assemblies and Legislative Councils of States.
The Act also sought to confer on the President the powers to delimit,
after consultation with the Election Commission, the various constituencies
for the purpose of elections to fill seats in the House of the People and in
the Legislative Assemblies and Legislative Councils of States.
The Act further provided for the registration of electors for Parliamentary
Constituencies and for the Assembly and Council Constituencies, and the
qualifications and disqualifications for such registration.
To sum-up, the Act makes the following provisions relating to the
elections:
1.  Allocation of seats in the House of the People, the State Legislative
Assemblies and the State Legislative Councils.
2.  Delimitation of Parliamentary, Assembly and Council
Constituencies.
3.  Election officers like chief electoral officers, district election
officers, electoral registration officers and so on.
4.  Electoral rolls for Parliamentary, Assembly and Council
constituencies.
5.  Manner of filling seats in the Council of States to be filled by
representatives of union territories.
6.  Local authorities for purposes of elections to the State Legislative
Councils.
7.  Barring the jurisdiction of civil courts.
REPRESENTATION OF THE PEOPLE ACT, 1951

provisions relating to elections but merely provided for the allocation of
seats in and the delimitation of constituencies for the purpose of elections to
the House of People and Legislatures of States, the qualifications of voter at
such election and the preparations of electoral rolls.
The provisions for the actual conduct of elections to the Houses of
Parliament and to the House or Houses of the Legislature of each State, the
qualifications and disqualifications for the membership of these Houses, the
corrupt practices and other election offences, and the decision of election
disputes were all left to be made in a subsequent measure. In order to
provide for these provisions, the Representation of the People Act, 1951

DELIMITATION ACT, 2002
Articles 82 and 170 of the Constitution of India provide for readjustment
and the division of each State into territorial constituencies (Parliamentary
constituencies and Assembly constituencies) on the basis of the 2001
census by such authority and in such manner as Parliament may, by law,
determine.
Further, Articles 330 and 332 of the Constitution of India provide for refixing the number of seats reserved for the Scheduled Castes and the
Scheduled Tribes in the House of the People and Legislative Assemblies of
the States on the basis of the 2001 census.
The present delimitation of Parliamentary and Assembly constituencies is
based on the 1971 census. The uneven growth of population in different
constituencies in different parts of the country as well as within the same
State as also continuous migration of people / electorate from one place to
other especially from rural areas to urban areas have resulted in strikingly
differing sizes of electoral constituencies even within the same State.
Therefore, the Delimitation Act, 20021
, was enacted to set up a
Delimitation Commission for the purpose of effecting delimitation on the
basis of the 2001 census so as to correct the aforesaid distortion in the sizes
of electoral constituencies. The proposed Delimitation Commission would
also re-fix the number of seats for the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled
Tribes on the basis of the 2001 census, without affecting total number of
seats based on the 1971 census.
The Act sought to lay down certain guidelines as to the manner in which
such delimitation would be undertaken. In the Act, the new Delimitation
Commission was given the task of carrying out delimitation of
Parliamentary and Assembly constituencies. It had been specifically
provided that the Delimitation Commission shall endeavour to complete the
work within a period not later than July 31, 2008.2
The proposed delimitation would apply to every general election to the
House of the People or to a State Legislative Assembly held after the final
orders of the Commission are published and to every bye-election arising
from such general election3

Based on the recommendations made by the above Committees and
Commissions, various reforms have been introduced in our electoral
system, election machinery and election process. These can be studied
under the following four heads.
•  Electoral reforms before 1996
•  Electoral reforms of 1996
•  Electoral reforms after 1996
•  Electoral reforms since 2010
ELECTORAL REFORMS BEFORE 1996
Lowering of Voting Age
The 61st Constitutional Amendment Act of 19884
reduced the voting age
from 21 years to 18 years for the Lok Sabha as well as the assembly
elections. This was done in order to provide to the unrepresented youth of
the country an opportunity to express their feelings and help them become a
part of political process.
Deputation to Election Commission
In 19885
, a provision was made that the officers and the staff engaged in
preparation, revision and correction of electoral rolls for elections are
deemed to be on deputation to the Election Commission for the period of
such employment. These personnel, during that period, would be under the
control, superintendence and discipline of the Election Commission.
Increase in Number of Proposers
In 19886
, the number of electors who are required to sign as proposers in
nomination papers for elections to the Rajya Sabha and state legislative
council has been increased to 10 per cent of the electors of the constituency
or ten such electors, whichever is less. This was done in order to prevent
non-serious candidates from contesting frivolously.
Electronic Voting Machines
In 19897
, a provision was made to facilitate the use of Electronic Voting
Machines (EVMs) in elections. The EVMs were used for the first time in
1998 on experimental basis in selected constituencies in the elections to the
Assemblies of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Delhi. The EVMs were used
for the first time in the general elections (entire state) to the Assembly of
Goa in 1999.
Booth Capturing
In 19898
, a provision was made for adjournment of poll or countermanding
of elections in case of booth capturing. Booth capturing includes: (i) seizure
of a polling station and making polling authorities surrender ballot papers or
voting machines (ii) taking possession of polling station and allowing only
one’s own supporters to exercise their franchise (iii) threatening and
preventing any elector from going to polling station and (iv) seizure of the
place being used for counting of votes.
Elector’s Photo Identity Card (EPIC)
The use of electors’ photo identity cards by the Election Commission is
surely making the electoral process simple, smoother and quicker. A
decision was taken by the Election Commission in 1993 to issue photo
identity cards to electors throughout the country to check bogus voting and
impersonation of electors at elections. The electoral roll is the basis for
issue of EPICs to the registered electors. The electoral rolls are normally
revised every year with 1
st January of the year as the qualifying date. Every
Indian citizen who attain the age of 18 years or above as on that date is
eligible for inclusion in the electoral roll and can apply for the same. Once
he is registered in the roll, he would be eligible for getting an EPIC. The
scheme of issuing the EPICs is, therefore, a continuous and ongoing process
for the completion of which no time limit can be fixed as the registration of
electors is a continuous and ongoing process (excepting for a brief period
between the last date for filing nomination and completion of electoral
process) on account of more number of persons becoming eligible for the
right of franchise on attaining the age of 18. It is the continuous effort of the
Election Commission to provide the EPICs to the electors who have been
left out in the previous campaigns as well as the new electors.8a
ELECTORAL REFORMS OF 1996
In 1990, the National Front Government headed by V.P. Singh appointed a
committee on electoral reforms under the chairmanship of Dinesh
Goswami, the then Law Minister. The Committee was asked to study the
electoral system in detail and suggest measures for remedying the
drawbacks within it. The Committee, in its report submitted in 1990 itself,
made a number of proposals on electoral reforms. Some of these
recommendations were implemented in 19969
. These are explained here.
Listing of Names of Candidates
The candidates contesting elections are to be classified into three categories
for the purpose of listing of their names. They are
(i) Candidates of recognised political parties
(ii) Candidates of registered-unrecognised political parties
(iii) Other (independent) candidates
Their names in the list of contesting candidates and in the ballot papers
has to appear separately in the above order and in each category these have
to be arranged in the alphabetical order.
Disqualification for Insulting the National Honour Act
A person who is convicted for the following offences under the Prevention
of Insults to National Honour Act of 1971 is disqualified to contest in the
elections to the Parliament and state legislature for 6 years.
(i) Offence of insulting the National Flag
(ii) Offence of insulting the Constitution of India
(iii) Offence of preventing the singing of National Anthem
Prohibition on the Sale of Liquor
No liquor or other intoxicants are to be sold or given or distributed at any
shop, eating place, hotel or any other place whether public or private within
a polling area during the period of 48 hours ending with the hour fixed for
the conclusion of poll. Any person who violates this rule is to be punished
with imprisonment up to 6 months or with fine up to ₹2,000 or with both.
Number of Proposers
The nomination of a candidate in a Parliamentary or assembly constituency
should be subscribed by 10 registered electors of the constituency as
proposers, if the candidate is not sponsored by a recognised political party.
In the case of a candidate sponsored by a recognised political party, only
one proposer is required. This was done in order to discourage non-serious
people from contesting the elections.
Death of a Candidate
Earlier, in case of death of a contesting candidate before the actual polling,
the election used to be countermanded. Consequently, the election process
had to start all over again in the concerned constituency. But now, the
election would not be countermanded on the death of a contesting candidate
before the actual polling. However, if the deceased candidate belonged to a
recognised political party, the party concerned would be given an option to
propose another candidate within seven days.
Time Limit for By-Elections
Now, by-elections are to be held within six months of occurrence of the
vacancy in any House of Parliament or a state legislature. But, this
condition is not applicable in two cases:
(i) Where the remainder of the term of the member whose vacancy is
to be filled is less than one year; or
(ii) When the Election Commission in consultation with the Central
Government, certifies that it is difficult to hold the by-elections
within the said period.
Holiday to Employees on the Polling Day
The registered voters employed in any trade, business, industry or any other
establishment are entitled to a paid holiday on the polling day. This rule
applies even to the daily wagers. Any employer who violates this rule is to
be punished with a fine up to ₹500. However, this rule is not applicable in
the case of a voter whose absence may cause danger or substantial loss in
respect of the employment in which he is engaged.
Contestants Restricted to Two Constituencies
A candidate would not be eligible to contest from more than two
Parliamentary or assembly constituencies at a general election or at the byelections which are held simultaneously. Similar restrictions are imposed
for biennial elections and by-elections to the Rajya Sabha and the state
legislative councils.
Prohibition of Arms
Entering into the neighbourhood of a polling station with any kind of arms10
is to be considered a cognizable offence. Such an act is punishable with
imprisonment of up to two years or with fine or with both. Further, the arms
found in possession of the offender are to be confiscated and the related
licence is to be cancelled. But, these provisions are not applicable to the
returning officer, presiding officer, any police officer or any other person
appointed to maintain peace and order at the polling station.
Effective Campaigning Period Reduced
The minimum gap between the last date for withdrawal of candidature and
the polling date has been reduced from 20 to 14 days.
ELECTORAL REFORMS AFTER 1996
Presidential and Vice Presidential Elections
In 199711
, the number of electors as proposers and seconders for contesting
election to the office of the President was increased from 10 to 50 and to the
office of the Vice President from 5 to 20. Further, the amount of security
deposit was increased from ₹2,500 to ₹15,000 for contesting election to
both the offices of President and Vice-President to discourage frivolous
candidates.
Requisitioning of Staff for Election Duty
In 199812
, a provision was made whereby the employees of local
authorities, nationalised banks, universities, LIC, government undertakings
and other government-aided institutions can be requisitioned for
deployment on election duty.
Voting through Postal Ballot
In 199913
, a provision was made for voting by certain classes of persons
through postal ballot. Thus, any class of persons can be notified by the
Election Commission, in consultation with the government, and the persons
belonging to such notified class can give their votes by postal ballot, and
not in any other manner, at elections in their constituency or constituencies.
Facility to Opt to Vote Through Proxy
In 200314
, the facility to opt to vote through proxy was provided to the
service voters belonging to the Armed Forces and members belonging to a
Force to which provisions of the Army Act apply. Such service voters who
opt to vote through proxy have to appoint a proxy in a prescribed format
and intimate the Returning Officer of the constituency.
Declaration of Criminal Antecedents, Assets, etc., by Candidates
In 2003, the election Commission issued an order15 directing every
candidate seeking election to the Parliament or a State Legislature to furnish
on his nomination paper the information on the following matters.
(i) Whether the candidate has been convicted or acquitted or
discharged in any criminal offence in the past? Whether he/she
was imprisoned or fined?
(ii) Prior to six months of filing nomination, whether the candidate is
accused in any pending case, of any offence punishable with
imprisonment for two years or more, and in which charges were
framed or cognizance was taken by a court; if so, the details
thereof
(iii) The assets (immovable, movable, bank balances, etc.) of a
candidate and his/ her spouse and that of dependents
(iv) Liabilities, if any, particularly whether there are any dues of any
public financial institution or government dues
(v) The educational qualifications of the candidate
Furnishing of any false information in the affidavit is now an electoral
offence punishable with imprisonment upto six months or fine or both.
Changes in Rajya Sabha Elections:
In 2003, the following two changes were introduced with respect to
elections to the Rajya Sabha16
 :
(i) Domicile or residency requirement of a candidate contesting an
election to the Rajya Sabha was removed. Prior to this, a candidate
had to be an elector in the state from where he was to be elected.
Now, it would be sufficient if he is an elector in any parliamentary
constituency in the country.
(ii) Introducing open ballot system, instead of secret ballot system, for
elections to the Rajya Sabha. This was done to curb cross-voting
and to wipe out the role of money power during Rajya Sabha
elections. Under the new system, an elector belonging to a
political party has to show the ballot paper after marking his vote
to a nominated agent of that political party.
Exemption of Travelling Expenditure
As per a provision of 200317
, the traveling expenditure incurred by the
campaigning leaders of a political party shall be exempted from being
included in the election expenses of the candidate.
Free Supply of Electoral Rolls, etc.
According to a 2003 provision18
, the Government should supply, free of
cost, the copies of the electoral rolls and other prescribed material to the
candidates of recognised political parties for the Lok Sabha and Assembly
elections. Further, the Election Commission should supply specified items
to the voters in the constituencies concerned or to the candidates set up by
the recognised political parties.
Parties Entitled to Accept Contribution
In 200319
, the political parties were entitled to accept any amount of
contribution from any person or company other than a government
company. They have to report any contribution in excess of ₹20,000 to the
Election Commission for making any claim to any income tax relief.
Besides, the companies would get income tax exemption on the amount
contributed.
Allocation of Time on Electronic Media
Under a 2003 provision20
, the Election Commission should allocate
equitable sharing of time on the cable television network and other
electronic media during elections to display or propagate any matter or to
address public. This allocation would be decided on the basis of the past
performance of a recognised political party.
Introduction of Braille Signage Features in EVMs
The Commission received representations from the various associations of
visually impaired persons for introduction of Braille signage features in the
EVMs to facilitate the visually impaired voters to cast their votes without
the help of attendant. The Commission considered the proposal in detail and
tried the Braille signage feature in the EVMs during the bye-election to the
Asifnagar Assembly Constituency of Andhra Pradesh held in 2004. In
2005, it was tried in one of the constituency during the Assembly elections
of Bihar, Jharkhand and Haryana. In 2006, it was tried in one of the
constituency of the States of Assam, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Puducherry
and Kerala during Assembly elections. In 2008, it was tried in all the
assembly constituencies of NCT of Delhi during Assembly elections.
The Commission introduced similar Braille signage features on the
Electronic Voting Machines during the General Elections to the Fifteenth
Lok Sabha (2009) and simultaneous Assembly elections in some States.20a
ELECTORAL REFORMS SINCE 2010
Restrictions Imposed on Exit Polls
According to a 2009 provision21
, conducting exit polls and publishing
results of exist polls would be prohibited during the election to Lok Sabha
and State Legislative Assemblies. Thus, no person shall conduct any exit
poll and publish or publicise by means of the print or electronic media or
disseminate in any other manner, the result of any exit poll during the
period notified by the Election Commission in this regard. Further, any
person who contravenes this provision shall be punishable with
imprisonment of upto two years or with fine or with both.
“Exit-poll” is an opinion survey regarding how electors have voted at an
election or how all the electors have performed with regard to the
identification of a political party or candidate in an election.
Time-Limit for Submitting a Case for Disqualification
In 200922
, a provision was made for the simplification of the procedure for
disqualification of a person found guilty of corrupt practices. It provided for
a three-month time-limit within which the specified authority will have to
submit the case of a person found guilty of corrupt practice to the President
for determination of the question of disqualification.
All Officials Included in Corrupt Practice
In 200923
, a provision was made for the inclusion of all officials, whether in
the government service or not, appointed or deputed by the Election
Commission in connection with the conduct of elections, within the scope
of corrupt practice of obtaining any assistance by a candidate for the
furtherance of the prospects of his election.
Increase in Security Deposit
In 200924
, the amount of security deposit to be paid by the candidates
contesting elections to the Lok Sabha was increased from ₹10,000 to
₹25,000 for the general candidates and from ₹5,000 to ₹12,500 for SC and
ST candidates. Similarly, the security deposit in the case of elections to the
state legislative assembly was increased from ₹5,000 to ₹10,000 for the
general candidates and from ₹2,500 to ₹5,000 for the SC and ST
candidates. This was done in order to check the multiplicity of non-serious
candidates.
Appellate Authority within the District
In 200925
, a provision was made for appointment of an appellate authority
within the district against the orders of the Electoral Registration Officers,
instead of the Chief Electoral Officer of the state. Thus, an appeal against
any order of the Electoral Registration Officer of a constituency (during
continuous updation of the electoral roll) will now lie before the District
Magistrate or Additional District Magistrate or Executive Magistrate or
District Collector or an officer of equivalent rank. A further appeal against
any order of the District Magistrate or Additional District Magistrate will
now lie before the Chief Electoral Officer of the state.
Voting Rights to Citizens of India Living Abroad
In 201026
, a provision was made to confer voting rights to the citizens of
India residing outside India due to various reasons. Accordingly, every
citizen of India - (a) whose name is not included in the electoral roll (b)
who has not acquired the citizenship of any other country (c) who is absent
from his place of ordinary residence in India owing to his employment,
education or otherwise outside India (whether temporarily or not) - shall be
entitled to have his name registered in the electoral roll in the Parliamentary
/ Assembly constituency in which his place of residence in India as
mentioned in his passport is located.
Online Enrolment in the Electoral Roll
In 2013, a provision was made for online filing of applications for
enrolment in the electoral roll. For this purpose, the Central Government,
after consulting the Election Commission, made the rules known as the
Registration of the Electors (Amendment) Rules, 2013.27 These rules made
certain amendments in the Registration of Electors Rules, 1960.
Introduction of NOTA Option
According to the directions of Supreme Court, the Election Commission
made provision in the ballot papers / EVMs for None of the Above (NOTA)
option so that the voters who come to the polling booth and decide not to
vote for any of the candidates in the fray, are able to exercise their right not
to vote for such candidates while maintaining the secrecy of their ballot.
The provision for NOTA has been made since General Election to State
Legislative Assemblies of Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Mizoram, NCT
of Delhi and Rajasthan in 2013 and continued in the General Election to
State Legislative Assemblies of Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh,
Odisha and Sikkim in 2014 along with the General Elections to the
Sixteenth Lok Sabha (2014).28
The voters polled against the NOTA option are not taken into account for
calculating the total valid voters polled by the contesting candidates for the
purpose of return of security deposits to candidates. Even if the number of
electors opting for NOTA options is more than the number of votes polled
by any of the candidates, the candidate who secures the largest number of
votes has to be declared elected.29
In 2001, the ECI had sent a proposal to the Government to amend the law
so as to provide for a neutral vote provision for the electors who did not
wish to vote for any of the candidates. In 2004, PUCL (People’s Union for
Civil Liberties) filed a petition seeking a direction to provide the necessary
provision in ballot papers and EVMs for protection of the right to not vote
for any candidate, secretly. The Supreme Court in 2013 held that the ECI
may provide for the None of the Above (NOTA) option on EVMs and
ballot papers.30
Introduction of VVPAT
The Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail is an independent system attached
with the EVMs that allows the voters to verify that their votes are cast as
intended. When a vote is cast, a slip is printed and remains exposed through
a transparent window for seven seconds, showing the serial number, name
and symbol of the candidate. Thereafter, the receipt automatically gets cut
and falls into the sealed dropbox of the VVPAT. The system allows a voter
to challenge his/her vote on the basis of the paper receipt. As per rules, the
Presiding Officer of the polling booth will have to record the dissent of the
voter, which would have to be taken into account at the time of counting, if
the challenge is found to be false.31
The law for using VVPATs was amended in 2013. In 2013, the Supreme
Court of India had permitted the ECI to introduce VVPAT in a phased
manner, calling it ‘an indispensable requirement of free and fair elections’.
The Court had felt that introducing VVPAT would ensure the accuracy of
the voting system and also help in manual counting of votes in case of
dispute. VVPATs were first used in byeelection to the Noksen Assembly
Constituency of Nagaland held in 2013. Thereafter, VVPATs have been
used in selected constituencies during every General Election to State
Legislative Assemblies. VVPATs were used in eight selected Parliamentary
Constituencies in the country in the 2014 Lok Sabha Election. EVMs with
VVPAT ensure the accuracy and transparency of the voting system.32
Persons in Jail or Police Custody Can Contest Elections
In 2013,33
the Supreme Court upheld an order of the Patna High Court
declaring that a person who has no right to vote by reason of being in jail or
in police custody, is not an elector and is, therefore, not qualified to contest
the elections to the Parliament or the State Legislature. In order to negate
this order of the Supreme Court, the following two new provisions34 have
been included in the Representation of the People Act, 1951:
(i) The first provision expressly provides that by reason of the
prohibition to vote (either due to in jail or in police custody), a
person whose name has been entered in the electoral roll shall not
cease to be an elector.
(ii) The second provision expressly provides that a Member of
Parliament or the State Legislature shall be disqualified only if he
is so disqualified under the provisions contained in the Act and on
no other ground.
Consequently, the persons in jail or in police custody are allowed to
contest the elections.
Immediate Disqualification of Convicted MPs and MLAs
In 2013,35
the Supreme Court held that chargesheeted Members of
Parliament and MLAs, on conviction for offences, will be immediately
disqualified from holding membership of the House without being given
three months’ time for appeal, as was the case before.
The concerned Bench of the Court struck down as unconstitutional
Section 8 (4) of the Representation of the People Act (1951) that allows
convicted lawmakers a three-month period for filing appeal to the higher
court and to get a stay of the conviction and sentence. The Bench, however,
made it clear that the ruling will be prospective and those who had already
filed appeals in various High Courts or the Supreme Court against their
convictions would be exempt from it.
The Bench said: “A reading of the two provisions in Articles 102 and 191
of the Constitution would make it abundantly clear that Parliament is to
make one law for a person to be disqualified for being chosen as, and for
being, a Member of either House of Parliament or Legislative Assembly or
Legislative Council of the State. Parliament thus does not have the power
under Articles 102 and 191 of the Constitution to make different laws for a
person to be disqualified for being chosen as a member and for a person to
be disqualified for continuing as a Member of Parliament or the State
Legislature.”
The Bench said: “Section 8 (4) of the Act which carves out a saving in
the case of sitting members of Parliament or State Legislature from the
disqualifications under the Act or which defers the date on which the
disqualification will take effect in the case of a sitting member of
Parliament or a State Legislature is beyond the powers conferred on
Parliament by the Constitution.”
The Bench held: “Looking at the affirmative terms of Articles 102 and
191 of the Constitution, we hold that Parliament has been vested with the
powers to make law laying down the same disqualifications for person to be
chosen as a member of Parliament or a State Legislature and for a sitting
member of a House of Parliament or a House of a State Legislature. We
also hold that the provisions of Article 101 and 190 of the Constitution
expressly prohibit Parliament to defer the date from which the
disqualification will come into effect in case of a sitting member of
Parliament or a State Legislature. Parliament, therefore, has exceeded its
powers conferred by the Constitution in enacting sub-section (4) of Section
8 of the Act and accordingly sub-section (4) of Section 8 of the Act is ultra
vires the Constitution36
 .”
In order to nullify the above ruling of the Supreme Court, the
Representation of the People (Second Amendment and Validation) Bill,
2013 was introduced in the Parliament. However, the Bill was later
withdrawn by the Government.
Ceiling on Election Expenditure
Increased In 201437
, the Central Government raised the maximum ceiling
on election expenditure by candidates for a Lok Sabha seat in bigger states
to ₹70 lakhs (from earlier ₹40 lakhs). In other states and union territories, it
is ₹54 lakhs (from earlier ₹16–40 lakhs).
Similarly, the limit for an Assembly seat in the bigger states was
increased to ₹28 lakhs (from earlier ₹16 lakhs). In other states and union
territories, it is 20 lakhs (from earlier ₹8–16 lakhs).
The State-wise limits are mentioned in Table 73.1 at the end of this
chapter.
Photos of Candidates on EVMs and Ballot Papers
According to an Election Commission order, in any election being held
after May 1, 2015, the ballot papers and EVMs will carry the picture of the
candidate with his or her name and party symbol to avoid confusion among
the electorates in constituencies where namesakes are contesting.
The June 2015 by polls to six seats in five states were the first elections
where photographs of candidates were used on ballot papers.
The Commission has noted that there are many cases where candidates
with same or similar names contest from the same constituency. Although
appropriate suffixes are added to the names of candidates in the event of
two or more candidates having same name, the Commission considers that
additional measures are required for removing confusion in the minds of
electors at the time of voting.
The photograph will appear between the name of the candidate and his or
her election symbol.
The Commission explained that if a candidate fails to provide the
photograph, it “shall not be a ground for the rejection of the nomination of
the candidate”.
The candidates will now be required to submit their recent photograph,
either black and white or coloured, to the election authorities at the time of
filing nomination. No uniforms would be allowed and caps and dark glasses
have to be avoided.38
Ceiling on Cash Donations Lowered:
In 2017 budget, the limit for anonymous cash donations by any individual
to a political party has been lowered from ₹20,000 to ₹2,000. This means
that now the political parties cannot receive more than ₹2,000 as cash
donations. However, they are not required to inform the Election
Commission of India the details of persons who donate under ₹2,000. They
must keep records of persons making above ₹2,000 donations.
Cap on Corporate Contributions Lifted:
In 2017 budget, the limit on corporate contributions from 7.5 per cent of the
net profit of a company’s past three financial years has been removed. This
means that now a company can donate any amount of money to any
political party. Further, the obligation of the company to report such
donations in its profit and loss account has also been lifted.
Introduction of Electoral Bonds:
In 2018, the central government notified the Electoral Bond Scheme. This
scheme was announced in the 2017 budget. It is touted as an alternative to
cash donations made to the political parties. It is aimed at bringing clean
money and substantial transparency into the system of political funding.
The salient features of the scheme are:
(i) The electoral bond means a bond issued in the nature of
promissory note which is a bearer banking instrument and does
not carry the name of the buyer or payee.
(ii) The electoral bonds may be purchased by a citizen of India or
entities incorporated or established in India.
(iii) The electoral bonds can be used for making donations to only
those registered political parties which have secured not less than
one per cent of the votes polled in the last general election to the
Lok Sabha or the State legislative Assembly.
(iv) The electoral bonds can be encashed by an eligible political party
only through a bank account with the authorized bank.
(v) The electoral bonds are issued in the denomination of ₹1,000,
₹10,000, ₹1,00,000, ₹10,00,000 and ₹1,00,00,000.
(vi) The information furnished by the buyer is treated confidential by
the authorized bank and is not to be disclosed to any authority for
any purposes, except when demanded by a competent court or
upon registration of criminal case by any law enforcement
agency.
Foreign Funding Allowed:
In 2018 budget, the receiving of foreign funds by the political parties has
been allowed. In other words, the political parties can now receive funds
from the foreign companies. Accordingly, the Foreign Contribution
(Regulation) Act, 2010, has been amended. Under this amendment, the
definition of a foreign company has been modified.

74 Voting Behaviour
MEANING OF VOTING BEHAVIOUR
Voting behaviour is also known as electoral behaviour. It is a form of
political behaviour. It implies the behaviour of voters in the context of
elections in a democratic political system.
Voting behaviour (or the study of voting behaviour) is defined in the
following way:
Plano and Riggs: “Voting behaviour is a field of study concerned with the
ways in which people tend to vote in public elections and the reasons why
they vote as they do.”
Gordon Marshall: “The study of voting behaviour invariably focuses on
the determinants of why people vote as they do and how they arrive at the
decisions they make”.1
Oinam Kulabidhu: “Voting behaviour may be defined as the behaviour
that explicitly reflects voter’s choices, preferences, alternatives, ideologies,
concerns, agreements, and programmes in respect of various issues,
questions pertaining to the society and nation”.2
Stephen Wasby: “The study of voting behaviour involves an analysis of
individual psychological make-up and their relation to political action as
well as institutional patterns, such as the communication process and their
impact on elections”.3
SIGNIFICANCE OF VOTING BEHAVIOUR
Psephology, a branch of political science, deals with the scientific study of
voting behaviour. This is a new term popularised by the American political
scientists and political sociologists.
The recorded history of voting goes back, at least, to the Greek Polis. The
modern world for the study of voting behaviour, psephology, derives from
the classical Greek ‘Psephos’, the piece of pottery on which certain votes,
mainly about the banishment of those seen as dangerous to the state, were
inscribed.4
The study of voting behaviour is significant for the following reasons:5
1.  It helps in comprehending the process of political socialisation.
2.  It helps in examining the internalisation of democracy as a value
among the elite as well as masses.
3.  It emphasises the real impact of revolutionary ballot box.
4.  It enables to throw light as to how far the electoral politics continue
or break with the past.
5.  It helps to measure whether it is modern or primordial in the
context of political development.
According to N.G.S. Kini, voting behaviour can be regarded as:
1.  A mode of legitimising democratic rule;
2.  Instancing “participation” in the political process involving
integration into the political community;
3.  Instancing an act of decision-making;
4.  A role-action involving definite political orientation imbedded in a
particular type of political culture; or
5.  A direct relation of the individual citizens to the formal
government.
DETERMINANTS OF VOTING BEHAVIOUR
Indian society is highly diversified in nature and composition. Hence,
voting behaviour in India is determined or influenced by multiple factors.
These several factors can be divided, into two broad categories, namely,
socioeconomic factors and political factors. These are explained below:
1.  Caste: Caste is an important factor influencing the behaviour of
voters. Politicisation of caste and casteism in politics has been a
remarkable feature of Indian politics. Rajni Kothari said “Indian
politics is casteist, and caste is politi-cised”.6 While formulating their
election strategies, the political parties always take into account the
factor of caste.
Paul Brass has very-well explained the role of caste factor in the
Indian voting behaviour in the following way: “At the local level, in
the country side, by far the most important factor in voting behaviour
remains caste solidarity. Large and important castes in a constituency
tend to back either a respected member of their caste or a political
party with whom their caste members identify. However, local factions
and local-state factional alignments that involve intercaste coalitions,
are also important factors in influencing voting behaviour”.7
2.  Religion: Religion is another significant factor which influences the
electoral behaviour. Political parties indulge in communal propaganda
and exploit the religious sentiments of the voters. The existence of
various communal parties has further added to the politicisation of
religion. Despite India being a secular nation, no political party ignores
the influence of religion in electoral politics.
3.  Language: Linguistic considerations of the people influence their
voting behaviour. During elections, the political parties arouse the
linguistic feelings of the people and try to influence their decisionmaking. The re-organisation of states (in 1956 and later) on language
basis clearly reflects the significance of language factor in Indian
politics. The rise of some political parties like DMK in Tamil Nadu
and TDP in Andhra Pradesh can be attributed to the linguism.8
4.  Region: Regionalism and sub-regionalism play an important role in
voting behaviour. These parochial feelings of subnationalism led to the
emergence and perpetuation of regional parties in various states. These
regional parties appeal to the electorate on the ground of regional
identities and regional sentiments. Sometimes, the secessionist parties
call for the boycott of elections.
5.  Personality: The charismatic9 personality of the party leader plays
an important role in electoral behaviour. Thus, the towering image of
Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi, Jay Prakash Narayan,
Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Narendra Modi has significantly influenced
the electorate to vote in favour of their parties. Similarly, at the state
level also, the charismatic personality of the regional party leader has
been a significant factor of popular support in the elections.
6.  Money: The role of money factor cannot be overlooked in
explaining the voting behaviour. Despite the limitations on the election
expenditures, crores of rupees are spent on elections. The voters seek
money or liquor or goods in return for their votes. In other words,
‘votes’ are freely exchanged for ‘notes’. However, money can
influence the decisions of the voters only in the normal circumstances
and not in a wave election.
Paul Brass has very-well explained the meaning of a wave election
in the following way: “A wave election is one in which a clear
tendency begins to develop among the electorate in a single direction
and in favour of a national party or its leader. It is based upon an issue
or set of issues that transcend local calculations and coalition and
draws the bulk of the uncommitted and wavering voters in the same
direction as the word spreads from village to village and tea stall to tea
stall”.10
7.  Performance of the Ruling Party: On the eve of elections, every
political party releases its election manifesto containing the promises
made by it to the electorate. The performance of the ruling party is
judged by the electorate on the basis of its election manifesto. The
defeat of Congress Party in 1977 elections and that of Janata Party in
1980 elections illustrates that the performance of the ruling party
influences the voting behaviour. Thus, the anti-incumbency factor
(which means dissatisfaction with the performance of the ruling party)
is a determinant of electoral behaviour.
8.  Party Identification: Personal and emotional association with
political parties plays a role in determining voting behaviour. People
who identify themselves with a particular party will always vote for
that party irrespective of its omissions and commissions. Party
identification was especially strong in the 1950s and 1960s. However,
since the 1970s, there has been a decline in the number of strong party
identifiers.
9.  Ideology: The political ideology professed by a political party has a
bearing on the decision-making of the voters. Some people in the
society are committed to certain ideologies like communism,
capitalism, democracy, secularism, patriotism, decentralisation and so
on. Such people generally support the candidates put up by the parties
professing those ideologies. However, it must be printed out here that
the number of such people is low.
10.  Other Factors: In addition to the aboveexplained factors, there
are also various other factors which determine the voting behaviour of
the Indian electorate. These are mentioned below:
(i) Political events preceding an election like war, murder of a
leader, corruption scandals, etc.
(ii) Economic conditions at the time of election like inflation,
food shortage, unemployment, etc.
(iii) Factionalism - a feature of Indian politics from bottom to
top levels
(iv) Age - old or young
(v) Sex - men or women
(vi) Education - educated or uneducated
(vii) Habitation - rural or urban (viii) Class (income) - rich or
poor
(ix) Family and kinship
(x) Candidate orientation
(xi) Election campaign
(xii) Political family background
(xiii) Role of media
ROLE OF MEDIA IN ELECTIONS AND VOTING
BEHAVIOUR
The following points explain the role of media in elections and voting
behaviour:11
1. Information Dissemination
Information dissemination in relation to elections, particularly during the
process of elections is extremely important for all stakeholders. Starting
from the announcement of elections to nomination, scrutiny, campaign,
security arrangements, polling, counting, declaration of results, etc., all of
these require widest circulation. The voter comes to know about the basics
like: what, when, where and how of elections generally through the media.
Even last minute changes of polling arrangements, violation of Model Code
of Conduct (MCC), and violation of expenditure instructions, any untoward
incidents or disturbances promptly come to the notice not only of the people
but also of the Election Commission through the media.
Newspapers and news channels have very enthusiastically made use of
the information relating to educational, financial and criminal antecedents
of candidates, contained in the affidavit filed by them along with their
nomination paper, which is immediately uploaded on the Election
Commission’s website. This has contributed to further honesty and
transparency in the election system.
2. Enforcement of MCC and other Laws
In today’s democratic and political landscape, the watch-dog role of the
media is quite vital. Media can highlight incidents of use of muscle and
money power by political parties or candidates and educate the electors on
ethical and inducement-free voting practices. It can also expose violations
of the MCC such as divisive or hate speeches or unverified allegations in
campaigns aimed at influencing electors. Violations reported by media are
followed up by the Election Commission as in dealing with formal
complaints.
The media can sensitise the political functionaries and the electorate
about the MCC and relevant laws and instructions governing the conduct of
elections.
3. Compliance to Election Laws
The Election Commission does not regulate media. It has however, the
responsibility to enforce the provisions of law or Court directions, which
might have linkages with media or certain aspects of media functioning.
During elections, media is present and active at all stages which would also
mean that they too conform to various laws governing the elections. These
laws are mentioned below:
(i) Section 126 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951: It
prohibits displaying any election matter by mean of
cinematograph, television or other similar apparatus, during the
period of 48 hours ending with the hour fixed for conclusion of
poll.
(ii) Section 126A of the Representation of the People Act, 1951: It
prohibits conduct of exit poll and dissemination of their results
during the period mentioned therein, i.e., the hour fixed for
commencement of polls in the first phase and half hour after the
time fixed for close of poll for the last phase in all the States and
Union Territories.
(iii) Section 127A of the Representation of the People Act, 1951: The
printing and publication of election pamphlets, posters, etc. is
governed by its provisions, which make it mandatory to bear on
its face the names and addresses of the printer and the publisher.
(iv) Section 171H of the Indian Penal Code: It prohibits incurring of
expenditure on, inter alia, advertisement without the authority of
the contesting candidate.
4. Voter Education and Participation
There is scope for a much larger and committed partnership from media in
the crucial area of voter awareness and participation. This is one of the most
promising areas of the Election Commission-media relationship.
There is a gap between what the voters ‘should know’ and what they
‘actually know’ in important areas like registration, EPIC/ identity proofs,
Polling Station location, use of EVMs, timings of the poll, use of money/
muscle power by candidates etc. The elector should be well-informed when
he/she goes to exercise his/ her franchise on the day of the polls.
Voter education helps build an environment where values of democracy
are understood and acted upon by the population. Media and civil society
have an important role to play in fostering such an environment. To
improve participation of all sections of the electorate, awareness levels need
to be enhanced, especially amongst the freshly eligible youth, uneducated,
residents of far-flung, inaccessible and remote areas, and socially and
economically weaker sections of the society. Such segments need to be
reached through the Media, apart from civil society and field based
organisations. The Election Commission has in place a framework of
engagement for collaboration between the Commission and Media Houses/
Organisations in this important area of voter participation. The Election
Commission expects that the Media should volunteer to take up this task of
informing, motivating and facilitating citizens to take part in the democratic
elections.
5. Responsibility of Government Media
In broadcast of election related news or analysis, Public Service
Broadcasters are expected to lead by example in terms of neutrality and
objectivity, and adhere to various guidelines including their own.
The Election Commission has a fruitful arrangement with Prasar Bharati
in providing free broadcast time on All India Radio and Doordarshan to
recognised National and State parties so as to ensure a level playing field in
elections. The political parties in this manner can reach out to every corner
of the country, even in the remotest parts. In addition to this, Prasar
Bharati’s contribution in spreading voter awareness and educating the
public about their voting rights and responsibilities is of great consequence
to the inclusion of all in the electoral process. The contribution of Prasar
Bharati has come in good measure in this arena.
The Election Commission also urges PIB, DAVP, National Film
Development Corporation, Directorate of Field Publicity, Song and Drama
Division and many other Central and State Information Directorates/
Departments to come forward and shoulder the same responsibility.

75 Coalition Government
MEANING OF COALITION GOVERNMENT
The term ‘coalition’ is derived from the Latin word ‘coalitio’ which means
‘to grow together’. Thus, technically, coalition means the act of uniting
parts into one body or whole. Politically, coalition means an alliance of
distinct political parties.
Coalition politics or coalition government has been defined in the
following way:
When several political parties join hands to form a government and
exercise political power on the basis of a common agreed
programme/agenda, we can describe the system as coalition politics or
coalition government1
 .
Coalitions usually occur in modern parliaments when no single political
party can muster a majority of votes. Two or more parties, who have
enough elected members between them to form a majority, may then be
able to agree on a common programme that does not require too many
drastic compromises with their individual policies, and can proceed to form
a government2
 .
Coalition denotes a co-operative arrangement under which distinct
political parties, or at all events members of such parties, unite to form a
government or ministry3
 .
Coalition is a direct descendant of the exigencies of multi-party system in
a democratic set-up. It is a phenomenon of a multi-party government where
a number of minority parties join hands for the purpose of running the
government. A coalition is formed when many splinter groups in a House
agree to join hands on a common platform by sinking their broad
differences and form a majority in the House4
 .
FEATURES OF COALITION GOVERNMENT
The features or implications of coalition politics or coalition government
are very well summarised by J.C. Johari in the following way5
 :
1.  Coalitions are formed for the sake of some reward, material or
psychic.
2.  A coalition implies the existence of at least two partners.
3.  The underlying principle of a coalition system stands on the simple
fact of temporary conjunction of specific interest.
4.  Coalition politics is not a static but a dynamic affair as coalition
players and groups dissolve and form new ones.
5.  The keynote of coalition politics is compromise, and rigid dogma
has no place in it.
6.  A coalition government works on the basis of a minimum
programme, which may not be ideal for each partner of the coalition.
7.  Pragmatism and not ideology is the hallmark of coalition politics.
In making political adjustments, principles may have to be set aside.
8.  The purpose of a coalition adjustment is to seize power.
In our country, we have seen coalitions coming up either before the
elections or after the elections. The pre-poll coalition is considerably
advantageous because it provides a common platform to the parties in order
to woo the electorate on the basis of a joint manifesto. The post-election
union is intended to enable constituents to share political power and run the
government6
 .
FORMATION OF COALITION GOVERNMENTS
In the first four Lok Sabha elections (1952, 1957, 1962 and 1967), the
Congress party secured the required majority to form the government at the
Centre. Even though there was a split in the Congress party in 1969, the
minority government of Indira Gandhi managed to continue with the
outside support of the CPI, the DMK and other parties. Again, the Congress
party won the 1971 elections and formed a single-party government.
However, the dominant Congress party was badly defeated in the 1977
elections. Since then, there have been a number of coalition governments at
the Centre. The details are mentioned in Table 75.1.

MERITS OF COALITION GOVERNMENT
The various advantages or strengths of the coalition governments are as
follows:
1.  There is an accommodation of diverse interests in the functioning
of the government. A coalition government acts as a channel to meet
the expectations and redress the grievances of different groups.
2.  India is a highly diversified country. There are different cultures,
languages, castes, religions and ethnic groups, and all these get
represented in the coalition governments. This means that a coalition
government is more representative in nature and it better reflects the
popular opinion of the electorate. In other words, it represents a much
more broader spectrum of public opinion than the single-party
government.
3.  A coalition government comprises different political parties having
their own ideologies or agendas. But, the governmental policy requires
the concurrence of all the coalition partners. Therefore, a coalition
government leads to consensus-based politics. In other words, there is
consensual decision-making in the coalition governments.
4.  Coalition politics strengthens the federal fabric of the Indian
political system. This is because a coalition government is more
sensitive and responsive to the regional demands and concerns than the
single-party government.
5.  A coalition government reduces the tyranny of government
(despotic rule). This is due to the reduced domination of a single
political party in the functioning of the government. All the members
of the coalition participate in the political decision-making. In short,
the decisions made are more balanced.
DEMERITS OF COALITION GOVERNMENT
The various disadvantages or weaknesses of the coalition governments are
as follows:
1.  They are unstable or prone to instability. The difference of opinion
among the coalition partners on policy issues leads to the collapse of
the government.
2.  Leadership of the Prime Minister is a principle of parliamentary
form of government. This principle is curtailed in a coalition
government as the Prime Minister is required to consult the coalition
partners before taking any major decision. The critics have called them
as ‘Super Prime Ministers’ or ‘Ultra Prime Ministers’.
3.  The Steering Committee or the Co-ordination Committee of the
coalition partners acts as the ‘Super-Cabinet’, and thereby it
undermines the role and position of the cabinet in the functioning of
the governmental machinery.
4.  There is a possibility of the smaller constituents of the coalition
government playing the role of a ‘King-maker’. They demand more
than their strength in the Parliament.
5.  The leaders of regional parties bring in the regional factors in the
national decision-making. They pressurise the central executive to act
on their lines; otherwise, they would threaten to withdraw from the
coalition.
6.  The size of the Council of Ministers in a coalition government is
generally quite large. This is because the ministry has to reflect all the
constituents of the coalition. For example, the A.B. Vajpayee ministry
of 1999 had 70-plus ministers and it was called as ‘Jumbo Ministry’.
This creates the problem of distribution of portfolios as well as the
proper coordination among the members.
7.  The members of coalition governments do not assume
responsibility for the administrative failures and lapses. They play
blame games and thereby escape from both collective responsibility as
well as individual responsibility.

76 Anti-Defection Law
The 52nd Amendment Act of 1985 provided for the disqualification of the
members of Parliament and the state legislatures on the ground of defection
from one political party to another. For this purpose, it made changes in
four Articles1 of the Constitution and added a new Schedule (the Tenth
Schedule) to the Constitution. This act is often referred to as the ‘antidefection law’.
Later, the 91st Amendment Act of 2003 made one change in the
provisions of the Tenth Schedule. It omitted an exception provision i.e.,
disqualification on ground of defection not to apply in case of split.
PROVISIONS OF THE ACT
The Tenth Schedule contains the following provisions with respect to the
disqualification of members of Parliament and the state legislatures on the
ground of defection:
1. Disqualification
Members of Political Parties: A member of a House belonging to any
political party becomes disqualified for being a member of the House, (a) if
he voluntarily gives up his membership of such political party; or (b) if he
votes or abstains from voting in such House contrary to any direction issued
by his political party without obtaining prior permission of such party and
such act has not been condoned by the party within 15 days.
From the above provision it is clear that a member elected on a party
ticket should continue in the party and obey the party directions.
Independent Members: An independent member of a House (elected
without being set up as a candidate by any political party) becomes
disqualified to remain a member of the House if he joins any political party
after such election.
Nominated Members: A nominated member of a House becomes
disqualified for being a member of the House if he joins any political party
after the expiry of six months from the date on which he takes his seat in
the House. This means that he may join any political party within six
months of taking his seat in the House without inviting this disqualification.
2. Exceptions
The above disqualification on the ground of defection does not apply in the
following two cases:
(a)  If a member goes out of his party as a result of a merger of the
party with another party. A merger takes place when two-thirds of the
members of the party have agreed to such merger.
(b)  If a member, after being elected as the presiding officer of the
House, voluntarily gives up the membership of his party or rejoins it
after he ceases to hold that office. This exemption has been provided in
view of the dignity and impartiality of this office.
It must be noted here that the provision of the Tenth Schedule pertaining
to exemption from disqualification in case of split by one-third members of
legislature party has been deleted by the 91st Amendment Act of 2003. It
means that the defectors have no more protection on grounds of splits.
3. Deciding Authority
Any question regarding disqualification arising out of defection is to be
decided by the presiding officer of the House. Originally, the act provided
that the decision of the presiding officer is final and cannot be questioned in
any court. However, in Kihoto Hollohan case2
(1993), the Supreme Court
declared this provision as unconstitutional on the ground that it seeks to
take away the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and the high courts. It held
that the presiding officer, while deciding a question under the Tenth
Schedule, function as a tribunal. Hence, his decision like that of any other
tribunal, is subject to judicial review on the grounds of mala fides,
perversity, etc. But, the court rejected the contention that the vesting of
adjudicatory powers in the presiding officer is by itself invalid on the
ground of political bias3
 .
4. Rule-Making Power
The presiding officer of a House is empowered to make rules to give effect
to the provisions of the Tenth Schedule. All such rules must be placed
before the House for 30 days. The House may approve or modify or
disapprove them. Further, he may direct that any willful contravention by
any member of such rules may be dealt with in the same manner as a breach
of privilege of the House.
According to the rules made so, the presiding officer can take up a
defection case only when he receives a complaint from a member of the
House. Before taking the final decision, he must give the member (against
whom the complaint has been made) a chance to submit his explanation. He
may also refer the matter to the committee of privileges for inquiry. Hence,
defection has no immediate and automatic effect.
EVALUATION OF THE ACT
The Tenth Schedule of the Constitution (which embodies the anti-defection
law) is designed to prevent the evil or mischief of political defections
motivated by the lure of office or material benefits or other similar
considerations. It is intended to strengthen the fabric of Indian
parliamentary democracy by curbing unprincipled and unethical political
defections. Rajiv Gandhi, the then Prime Minister, described it as the ‘first
step towards cleaning-up public life’. The then Central law minister stated
that the passing of the 52nd Amendment Bill (anti-defection bill) by a
unanimous vote by both the Houses of Parliament was ‘a proof, if any, of
the maturity and stability of Indian democracy’.
Advantages
The following can be cited as the advantages of the anti-defection law:
(a)  It provides for greater stability in the body politic by checking the
propensity of legislators to change parties.
(b)  It facilitates democratic realignment of parties in the legislature by
way of merger of parties.
(c)  It reduces corruption at the political level as well as nondevelopmental expenditure incurred on irregular elections.
(d)  It gives, for the first time, a clear-cut constitutional recognition to
the existence of political parties.
Criticism
Though the anti-defection law been hailed as a bold step towards cleansing
our political life and started as new epoch in the political life of the country,
it has revealed may lacunae in its operation and failed to prevent defections
in toto. It came to be criticised on the following grounds:
1.  It does not make a differentiation between dissent and defection. It
curbs the legislator’s right to dissent and freedom of conscience. Thus,
‘it clearly puts party bossism on a pedestal and sanctions tyranny of
the party in the name of the party discipline’4
 .
2.  Its distinction between individual defection and group defection is
irrational. In other words, ‘it banned only retail defections and
legalised wholesale defections’5
 .
3.  It does not provide for the expulsion of a legislator from his party
for his activities outside the legislature.
4.  Its discrimination between an independent member and a
nominated member is illogical. If the former joins a party, he is
disqualified while the latter is allowed to do the same.
5.  Its vesting of decision-making authority in the presiding officer is
criticised on two grounds. Firstly, he may not exercise this authority in
an impartial and objective manner due to political exigencies.
Secondly, he lacks the legal knowledge and experience to adjudicate
upon the cases. In fact, two Speakers of the Lok Sabha (Rabi Ray–
1991 and Shivraj Patil–1993) have themselves expressed doubts on
their suitability to adjudicate upon the cases related to defections6
 .
91ST
 AMENDMENT ACT (2003)
Reasons
The reasons for enacting the 91st
 Amendment Act (2003) are as follows:
1.  Demands have been made from time to time in certain quarters for
strengthening and amending the Anti-defection Law as contained in
the Tenth Schedule, on the ground that these provisions have not been
able to achieve the desired goal of checking defections. The Tenth
Schedule has also been criticised on the ground that it allows bulk
defections while declaring individual defections as illegal. The
provision for exemption from disqualification in case of splits as
provided in the Tenth Schedule has, in particular, come under severe
criticism on account of its destabilising effect on the Government.
2.  The Committee on Electoral Reforms (Dinesh Goswami
Committee) in its report of 1990, the Law Commission of India in its
170th Report on “Reform of Electoral Laws” (1999) and the National
Commission to Review the Working of the Constitution (NCRWC) in
its report of 2002 have, inter alia, recommended omission of the
provision of the Tenth Schedule pertaining to exemption from
disqualification in case of splits.
3.  The NCRWC was also of the view that a defector should be
penalised for his action by debarring him from holding any public
office as a minister or any other remunerative political post for at least
the duration of the remaining term of the existing Legislature or until,
the next fresh elections whichever is earlier.
4.  The NCRWC has also observed that abnormally large Councils of
Ministers were being constituted by various Governments at Centre
and states and this practice had to be prohibited by law and that a
ceiling on the number of ministers in a state or the Union Government
be fixed at the maximum of 10% of the total strength of the popular
House of the Legislature.
Provisions
The 91st
 Amendment Act of 2003 has made the following provisions to limit
the size of Council of Ministers, to debar defectors from holding public
offices, and to strengthen the anti-defection law:
1.  The total number of ministers, including the Prime Minister, in the
Central Council of Ministers shall not exceed 15 per cent of the total
strength of the Lok Sabha.
2.  A member of either House of Parliament belonging to any political
party who is disqualified on the ground of defection shall also be
disqualified to be appointed as a minister.
3.  The total number of ministers, including the Chief Minister, in the
Council of Ministers in a state shall not exceed 15 per cent of the total
strength of the Legislative Assembly of that state. But, the number of
ministers, including the Chief Minister, in a state shall not be less than
12.
4.  A member of either House of a state legislature belonging to any
political party who is disqualified on the ground of defection shall also
be disqualified to be appointed as a minister.
5.  A member of either House of Parliament or either House of a State
Legislature belonging to any political party who is disqualified on the
ground of defection shall also be disqualified to hold any remunerative
political post. The expression “remunerative political post” means (i)
any office under the Central Government or a state government where
the salary or remuneration for such office is paid out of the public
revenue of the concerned government; or (ii) any office under a body,
whether incorporated or not, which is wholly or partially owned by the
Central Government or a state government and the salary or
remuneration for such office is paid by such body, except where such
salary or remuneration paid is compensatory in nature.
6.  The provision of the Tenth Schedule (anti-defection law) pertaining
to exemption from disqualification in case of split by one-third
members of legislature party has been deleted. It means that the
defectors have no more protection on grounds of splits.

take far-reaching decisions in the functioning of parliamentary
democracy. Vestiture of power to adjudicate questions under the Tenth
Schedule in such constitutional functionaries should not be considered
unexceptionable’.

not be endowed with legal acumen and proficiency in law. It is more
apt to have the cases decided by the Supreme Court or high court
judges’.
77 Pressure Groups
MEANING AND TECHNIQUES
The term ‘pressure group’ originated in the USA. A pressure group is a
group of people who are organised actively for promoting and defending
their common interest. It is so called as it attempts to bring a change in the
public policy by exerting pressure on the government. It acts as a liaison
between the government and its members.
The pressure groups are also called interest groups or vested groups.
They are different from the political parties in that they neither contest
elections nor try to capture political power. They are concerned with
specific programmes and issues and their activities are confined to the
protection and promotion of the interests of their members by influencing
the government.
The pressure groups influence the policymaking and policyimplementation in the government through legal and legitimate methods
like lobbying, correspondence, publicity, propagandising, petitioning,
public debating, maintaining contacts with their legislators and so forth.
However, some times they resort to illegitimate and illegal methods like
strikes, violent activities and corruption which damages public interest and
administrative integrity.
According to Odegard, pressure groups resort to three different
techniques in securing their purposes. First, they can try to place in public
office persons who are favourably disposed towards the interests they seeks
to promote. This technique may be labelled electioneering. Second, they
can try to persuade public officers, whether they are initially favourably
disposed toward them or not, to adopt and enforce the policies that they
think will prove most beneficial to their interests. This technique may be
labelled lobbying. Third, they can try to influence public opinion and
thereby gain an indirect influence over government, since the government
in a democracy is substantially affected by public opinion. This technique
may be labelled propagandizing1
 .
PRESSURE GROUPS IN INDIA
A large number of pressure groups exist in India. But, they are not
developed to the same extent as in the US or the western countries like
Britain, France, Germany and so on. The pressure groups in India can be
broadly classified into the following categories:
1. Business Groups
The business groups include a large number of industrial and commercial
bodies. They are the most sophisticated, the most powerful and the largest
of all pressure groups in India. They include:
(i) Federation of Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry
(FICCI); major constituents are the Indian Merchants Chamber of
Bombay, Indian Merchants Chamber of Calcutta and South
Indian Chamber of Commerce of Madras. It broadly represents
major industrial and trading interests.
(ii) Associated Chamber of Commerce and Industry of India
(ASSOCHAM); major constituents are the Bengal Chamber of
Commerce of Calcutta and Central Commercial Organisation of
Delhi. ASSOCHAM represents foreign British capital.
(iii) Federation of All India Foodgrain Dealers Association
(FAIFDA). FAIFDA is the sole representative of the grain
dealers.
(iv) All-India Manufacturers Organisation (AIMO). AIMO raises the
concerns of the medium-sized industry.
2. Trade Unions
The trade unions voice the demands of the industrial workers. They are also
known as labour groups. A peculiar feature of trade unions in India is that
they are associated either directly or indirectly with different political
parties. They include:
(i) All-India Trade Union Congress (AITUC)–affiliated to CPI
(ii) Indian National Trade Union Congress (INTUC)–affiliated to the
Congress
(iii) Hind Mazdoor Sabha (HMS)–affiliated to the Socialists
(iv) Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU)– affiliated to the CPM
(v) Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS)– affiliated to the BJP
First Trade Union in India: All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC) was
founded in 1920 with Lala Lajpat Rai as its first president. Upto 1945,
Congressmen, Socialists and Communists worked in the AITUC which was
the central trade union organisation of workers of India. Subsequently, the
trade union movement got split on political lines.
3. Agrarian Groups
The agrarian groups represent the farmers and the agricultural labour class.
They include:
(i) Bhartiya Kisan Union (in the wheat belt of North India)
(ii) All India Kisan Sabha (the oldest and the largest agrarian group)
(iii) Revolutionary Peasants Convention (organised by the CPM in
1967 which gave birth to the Naxalbari Movement)
(iv) Bhartiya Kisan Sangh (Gujarat)
(v) R.V. Sangham (Tamil Nadu)
(vi) Shetkhari Sanghatana (Maharashtra)
(vii) Hind Kisan Panchayat (controlled by the Socialists)
(viii) All-India Kisan Sammelan
(ix) United Kisan Sabha (controlled by the CPM)
4. Professional Associations
These are associations that raise the concerns and demands of doctors,
lawyers, journalists and teachers. Despite various restrictions, these
associations pressurise the government by various methods including
agitations for the improvement of their service conditions. They include:
(i) Indian Medical Association (IMA)
(ii) Bar Council of India (BCI)
(iii) Indian Federation of Working Journalists (IFWJ)
(iv) All India Federation of University and College Teachers
(AIFUCT)
5. Student Organisations
Various unions have been formed to represent the student community.
However, these unions, like the trade unions, are also affiliated to various
political parties. These are:
(i) Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) (affiliated to BJP)
(ii) All India Students Federation (AISF) (affiliated to CPI)
(iii) National Students Union of India (NSUI) (affiliated to Congress)
(iv) Student Federation of India (SFI) (affiliated to CPM)
6. Religious Organisations
The organisations based on religion have come to play an important role in
Indian politics. They represent the narrow communal interest. They include:
(i) Rashtriya Swayam Sevak Sangh (RSS)
(ii) Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP)
(iii) Jamaat-e-Islami
(iv) Ittehad-ul-Mussalmeen
(v) Anglo-Indian Association
(vi) Associations of the Roman Catholics
(vii) All-India Conference of Indian Christians (viii) Parsi Central
Association
(ix) Shiromani Akali Dal
“The Shiromani Akali Dal should be regarded as more of a religious
pressure group rather than a political party in view of the fact that it has
been concerned more with the mission of saving the sikh community from
being absorbed into the ocean of hindu society than with fighting for the
cause of a sikh homeland”2
 .
7. Caste Groups
Like religion, caste has been an important factor in Indian politics. The
competitive politics in many states of the Indian Union is in fact the politics
of caste rivalries: Brahmin versus Non-Brahmin in Tamil Nadu and
Maharashtra, Rajput versus Jat in Rajasthan, Kamma versus Reddy in
Andhra, Ahir versus Jat in Haryana, Baniya Brahmin versus Patidar in
Gujarat. Kayastha versus Rajput in Bihar, Nair versus Ezhava in Kerala and
Lingayat versus Okkaliga in Karnataka3
. Some of the caste-based
organisations are:
(i) Nadar Caste Association in Tamil Nadu
(ii) Marwari Association
(iii) Harijan Sevak Sangh
(iv) Kshatriya Maha Sabha in Gujarat
(v) Vanniyakul Kshatriya Sangam
(vi) Kayastha Sabha
8. Tribal Organisations
The tribal organisations are active in MP, Chattisgarh, Bihar, Jharkhand,
West Bengal and the North Eastern States of Assam, Manipur, Nagaland
and so on. Their demands range from reforms to that of secession from
India and some of them are involved in insurgency activities. The tribal
organisations include:
(i) National Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN)
(ii) Tribal National Volunteers (TNU) in Tripura
(iii) People’s Liberation Army in Manipur
(iv) All-India Jharkhand
(v) Tribal Sangh of Assam
(vi) United Mizo Federal Organisation
9. Linguistic Groups
Language has been so important factor in Indian politics that it became the
main basis for the reorganisation of states. The language along with caste,
religion and tribe have been responsible for the emergence of political
parties as well as pressure groups. Some of the linguistic groups are:
(i) Tamil Sangh
(ii) Anjuman Tarraki-i-Urdu
(iii) Andhra Maha Sabha
(iv) Hindi Sahitya Sammelan
(v) Nagari Pracharani Sabha
(vi) Dakshina Bharat Hindi Prachar Sabha
10. Ideology Based Groups
In more recent times, the pressure groups are formed to pursue a particular
ideology, i.e., a cause, a principle or a programme. These groups include:
(i) Environmental protection groups like Narmada Bachao Andolan,
and Chipko Movement
(ii) Democratic rights organisations
(iii) Civil liberties associations
(iv) Gandhi Peace Foundation
(v) Woman rights organisations
11. Anomic Groups
Almond and Powell observed: “By anomic pressure groups we mean more
or less a spontaneous breakthrough into the political system from the
society such as riots, demonstrations, assassinations and the like. The Indian
Government and bureaucratic elite, overwhelmed by the problem of
economic development and scarcity of resources available to them,
inevitably acquires a technocratic and anti-political frame of mind,
particularistic demands of whatever kinds are denied legitimacy. As a
consequence interest groups are alienated from the political system”4
. Some
of the anomic pressure groups are:
(i) All-India Sikh Student’s Federation.
(ii) Nava Nirman Samithi of Gujarat.
(iii) Naxalite Groups.
(iv) Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF).
(v) All Assam Student’s Union.
(vi) United Liberation Front of Assam (ULFA).
(vii) Dal Khalsa.

78 National Integration
India is a land of widespread diversities in terms of religion, language,
caste, tribe, race, region and so on. Hence, the achievement of national
integration becomes very essential for the all-around development and
prosperity of the country.
MEANING OF NATIONAL INTEGRATION
Definitions and statements on national integration:
“National integration implies avoidance of divisive movements that
would balkanise the nation and presence of attitudes throughout the society
that give preference to national and public interest as distinct from parochial
interests”1 Myron Weiner.
“National integration is a socio-psychological and educational process
through which a feeling of unity, solidarity and cohesion develops in the
hearts of the people and a sense of common citizenship or feeling of loyalty
to the nation is fostered among them”2 HA Gani.
“National integration is not a house which could be built by mortar and
bricks. It is not an industrial plan too which could be discussed and
implemented by experts. Integration, on the contrary, is a thought which
must go into the heads of the people. It is the consciousness which must
awaken the people at large” Dr. S. Radhakrishna.
“National integrations means, and ought to mean, cohesion not fusion,
unity but not uniformity, reconciliation but not merger, agglomeration but
not assimilation of the discrete segments of the people constituting a
political community or state”3 Rasheeduddin Khan.
To sum-up, the concept of national integration involves political,
economic, social, cultural and psychological dimensions and the interrelations between them.
OBSTACLES TO NATIONAL INTEGRATION
Among the major obstacles to national integration include:
1. Regionalism
Regionalism refers to sub-nationalism and sub-territorial loyalty. It implies
the love for a particular region or state in preference to the country as a
whole. There is also subregionalism, that is, love for a particular region in
preference to the state of which the region forms a part.
Regionalism is “a subsidiary process of political integration in India. It is
a manifestation of those residual elements which do not find expression in
the national polity and national culture, and being excluded from the
centrality of the new polity, express themselves in political discontent and
political exclusionism”4
 .
Regionalism is a country-wide phenomenon which manifests itself in the
following six forms:
(i) Demand of the people of certain states for secession from the
Indian Union (like Khalistan, Dravid Nad, Mizos, Nagas and so
on).
(ii) Demand of the people of certain areas for separate statehood (like
Telengana, Bodoland, Uttarkhand, Vidharbha, Gorkhaland and so
on).
(iii) Demand of people of certain Union Territories for full-fledged
statehood (like Manipur, Tripura, Puducherry, Delhi, Goa, Daman
and Diu and so on).
(iv) Inter-state boundary disputes (like Chandigarh and Belgaum) and
riverwater disputes (like Cauvery, Krishna, Ravi-Beas and so on).
(v) Formation of organisations with regional motives which
advocates a militant approach in pursuing its policies and goals
(like Shiv Sena, Tamil Sena, Hindi Sena, Sardar Sena, Lachit
Sena and so on).
(vi) ‘Sons of the soil theory’ which advocates preference to local
people in government jobs, private jobs, permits and so on. Their
slogan will be Assam for Assamese, Maharashtra for
Maharashtrians and so on.
2. Communalism
Communalism means love for one’s religious community in preference to
the nation and a tendency to promote the communal interest at the cost of
the interest of other religious communities. It has its roots in the British rule
where the 1909, 1919 and 1935 Acts had introduced communal
representation for the Muslims, Sikhs and others.
The communalism got accentuated with the politicisation of religion. Its
various manifestations are:
(i) Formation of political parties based on religion (like Akali Dal,
Muslim League, Ram Rajya Parishad, Hindu Mahasabha, Shiv
Sena and so on).
(ii) Emergence of pressure groups (nonpolitical entities) based on
religion (like RSS, Vishwa Hindu Parishad, Jamaat-e-Islami,
Anglo-Indian Christians Association and so on).
(iii) Communal riots (between Hindus and Muslims, Hindus and
Sikhs, Hindus and Christians and so on–Benaras, Lucknow,
Mathura, Hyderabad, Allahabad, Aligarh, Amritsar, Moradabad
and some other places are affected by communal violence).
(iv) Dispute over religious structures like temples, mosques and
others (The dispute over Ram Janma Bhoomi in Ayodhya where
the kar sevaks had demolished a disputed structure on December
6, 1992).
The reasons for the persistence of com-munalism include religious
orthodoxy of muslims, role of Pakistan, hindu chauvinism, government’s
inertia, role of political parties and other groups, electoral compulsions,
communal media, socio-economic factors and so on.
3. Casteism
Casteism implies love for one’s own caste-group in preference to the
general national interest. It is mainly an outcome of the politicisation of
caste. Its various manifestations include:
(i) Formation of political parties on the basis of caste (like Justice
Party in Madras, DMK, Kerala Congress, Republican Party,
Bahujan Samaj Party and so on).
(ii) Emergence of pressure groups (nonpolitical entities) based on
caste (like Nadar Association, Harijan Sevak Sangh, Kshatriya
Mahasabha and so on).
(iii) Allotment of party tickets during elections and the formation of
council of ministers in the states on caste lines.
(iv) Caste conflicts between higher and lower castes or between
dominant castes in various states like Bihar, Uttar Pradesh,
Madhya Pradesh and so on.
(v) Violent disputes and agitations over the reservation policy.
B.K. Nehru observed: “The communal electorates (of the British days) in
a vestigal form still remain in the shape of reservations for the Scheduled
Castes and Scheduled Tribes. They serve to emphasise caste origin and
make people conscious of the caste in which they were born. This is not
conducive to national integration”5
 .
At the state level, the politics is basically a fight between the major caste
groups like Kamma versus Reddy in Andhra Pradesh, Lingayat versus
Vokaligga in Karnataka, Nayar versus Ezhava in Kerala, Bania versus
Patidar in Gujarat, Bhumiar versus Rajput in Bihar, Jat versus Ahir in
Haryana, Jat versus Rajput in Uttar Pradesh, Kalita versus Ahom in Assam
and so on.
4. Linguism
Linguism means love for one’s language and hatred towards other
language-speaking people. The phenomena of linguism, like that of
regionalism, communalism or casteism, is also a consequence of political
process. It has two dimensions: (a) the reorganisation of states on the basis
of language; and (b) the determination of the official language of the Union.
The creation of the first linguistic state of Andhra out of the then Madras
state in 1953 led to the countrywide demand for the reorganisation of states
on the basis of language. Consequently, the states were reorganised on a
large-scale in 1956 on the basis of the recommendations made by the States
Reorganisation Commission6
 (1953–1955). Even after this, the political map
of India underwent a continuous change due to the pressure of popular
agitations and the political conditions, which resulted in the bifurcation of
existing states like Bombay, Punjab, Assam, and so on. By the end of 2000,
the number of states and union territories had reached 28 and 7 from that of
14 and 6 in 1956 respectively7
 .
The enactment of the Official Language Act (1963) making Hindi as the
Official Language of the Union led to the rise of anti-Hindi agitation in
South India and West Bengal. Then, the Central government assured that
English would continue as an ‘associate’ official language so long as the
non-Hindi speaking states desire it. Moreover, the three-language formula
(English, Hindi and a regional language) for school system is still not being
implemented in Tamil Nadu8
. Consequently, Hindi could not emerge as the
lingua franca of the composite culture of India as desired by the framers of
the Constitution.
The problem of linguism got accentuated with the rise of some regional
parties in recent times like the TDP, AGP, Shiv Sena and so on.
NATIONAL INTEGRATION COUNCIL
The National Integration Council (NIC) was constituted in 1961, following
a decision taken at a national conference on ‘unity in diversity’, convened
by the Central government, at New Delhi. It consisted of the prime minister
as chairman, central home minister, chief ministers of states, seven leaders
of political parties, the chairman of the UGC, two educationists, the
commissioner for SCs and STs and seven other persons nominated by the
prime minister. The council was directed to examine the problem of
national integration in all its aspects and make necessary recommendations
to deal with it. The council made various recommendations for national
integration. However, these recommendations remained only on paper and
no effort was made either by the Centre or by the states to implement them.
In 1968, the Central government revived the National Integration
Council. Its size was increased from 39 to 55 members. The representatives
of industry, business and trade unions were also included in it. The council
met at Srinagar and adopted a resolution condemning all tendencies that
struck at the root of national solidarity. It appealed to the political parties,
organisations and the press to mobilise the constructive forces of society in
the cause of national unity and solidarity. It also set up three committes to
report on regionalism, communalism and linguism respectively. However,
nothing tangible was achieved.
In 1980, the Central government again revived the National Integration
Council which had become defunct. Its membership was made more broadbased. It had three items on the agenda for discussion viz., the problem of
communal harmony, unrest in the north-eastern region and need for a new
education system. The council set up a standing committee to keep a
constant watch on the activities of communal and other divisive forces
posing a threat to the national unity.
In 1986, the NIC was reconstituted and its membership was further
increased. It recognised terrorism in Punjab as an attack on the unity,
integrity and secular ideals of the country. Accordingly, it passed a
resolution to fight terrorism in Punjab. The council also set up a 21-member
committee to function on a continuing basis. The committee was asked to
formulate both short-term as well as long-term proposals for maintaining
communal harmony and preserving national integrity.
In 1990, the National Front Government headed by V.P. Singh
reconstituted the National Integration Council. Its strength was increased to
101. It included prime minister as chairman, some Central ministers, state
chief ministers, leaders of national and regional parties, representatives of
women, trade and industry, academicians, journalists and public figures. It
had various items on the agenda for discussion, viz., Punjab problem,
Kashmir problem, violence by secessionists, communal harmony and Ram
Janmabhomi-Babri Masjid problem at Ayodhya. But, there was no concrete
result.
In 2005, the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) Government
reconstituted the National Integration Council under the chairmanship of
the Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh. The 103-member NIC was
constituted after a gap of 12 years having held its meeting in 1992. Besides
some central ministers, state and UT chief ministers and leaders of national
and regional parties, the NIC included chairpersons of National
Commissions, eminent public figures and representatives from business,
media, labour and women. The NIC was to function as a forum for effective
initiative and interaction on issues of national concern, review issues
relating to national integration and make recommendations.
The 14th meeting of the NIC was held in 2008 in the backdrop of
communal violence in various states like Orissa, Karnataka, Maharashtra,
Jammu and Kashmir and Assam and so on. Promotion of education among
minorities, scheduled castes and scheduled tribes; elements contributing to
national integration; removal of regional imbalances, caste and identity
divisions; prevention of extremism; promotion of communal harmony and
security among minorities; and equitable development were some of the
important items on the agenda of the meeting.
In April 2010, the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) Government again
reconstituted the National Integration Council (NIC) under the
chairmanship of the Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh. The NIC has 147
members, including Union Ministers, Leaders of the Opposition in the Lok
Sabha and the Rajya Sabha, the Chief Ministers of all states and union
territories with Legislatures. It also includes leaders of national and regional
political parties, chairpersons of national commissions, eminent journalists,
public figures, and representatives of business and women’s organisations.
It is chiefly aimed at suggesting means and ways to combat the menace of
communalism, casteism and regionalism.
In October 2010, the Government also constituted a Standing Committee
of the NIC. It consists of Union Home Minister as Chairman, four Union
Ministers, nine Chief Ministers of various states and five co-opted members
from NIC. It would finalise the agenda items for NIC meetings.
The 15th meeting of the NIC was held in September, 2011. The agenda
for the meeting included measures to curb communalism and communal
violence; approach to the Communal Violence Bill; measures to promote
communal harmony; measures to eliminate discrimination, especially
against minorities and scheduled tribes; how the state and the police should
handle civil disturbances; and how to curb radicalisation of youth in the
name of religion and caste.
The 16th meeting of the NIC was held on 23–09-2013. A Resolution was
passed in the meeting to condemn violence, take all measures to strengthen
harmonious relationship between all communities, to resolve differences
and disputes among the people within the framework of law, to condemn
atrocities on Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, to condemn sexual
abuse and to ensure that all women enjoy the fruits of freedom to pursue
their social and economic development with equal opportunities, and to
safeguard their right of movement in the public space at any time of the day
or night.

79 Foreign Policy
The foreign policy of India regulates India’s relations with other states of
the world in promoting its national interests. It is determined by a number
of factors, viz., geography, history and tradition, social structure, political
organisation, international milieu1
, economic position, military strength,
public opinion and leadership.
PRINCIPLES OF INDIAN FOREIGN POLICY
1. Promotion of World Peace
India’s foreign policy aims at the promotion of international peace and
security. Article 51 of the Constitution (Directive Principles of State Policy)
directs the Indian State to promote international peace and security,
maintain just and honourable relations between nations, foster respect for
international law and treaty obligations, and encourage settlement of
international disputes by arbitration. Besides peace is necessary to promote
the economic development of nations. Jawaharlal Nehru said: “Peace to us
is not just a fervent hope; it is emergent necessity”.
2. Anti-Colonialism
The foreign policy of India opposes colonialism and imperialism. India
views that the colonialism and imperialism leads to exploitation of the
weaker nations by the imperialist powers and affects the promotion of
international peace. India advocated the liquidation of colonialism in all
forms and supported the liberation movement in Afro-Asian countries like
Indonesia, Malaya, Tunisia, Algeria, Ghana, Namibia and so on. Thus,
India expressed her solidarity with the people of Afro-Asian nations in their
struggle against colonial and imperialist forces like Britain, France,
Holland, Portugal and so on. The present neo-colonialism and neoimperialism is also opposed by India.
3. Anti-Racialism
Opposition to racialism in all its forms is an important aspect of Indian
foreign policy. According to India, racialism (i.e., discrimination between
people on the basis of race), like colonialism and imperialism, leads to
exploitation of the blacks by the whites, social inequity and hinders the
promotion of world peace. India strongly criticised the policy of apartheid
(racial discrimination) being followed by the white minority racist regime
of South Africa. It even snapped diplomatic relations with South Africa in
1954 as a protest against the policy of apartheid2
. Similarly, India played an
important role in the liberation of Zimbabwe (earlier Rhodesia) and
Namibia from the white domination.
4. Non-Alignment
When India became independent in 1947, the world was divided into two
blocs on ideological basis, namely, the capitalist bloc headed by USA and
the communist bloc headed by the former USSR. In such a situation of
‘cold war’, India refused to join any of these two blocs and adopted a policy
of non-alignment. In this context, Jawaharlal Nehru observed: “We propose
to keep away from the power politics of groups, aligned against one
another, which have led in the past to world wars and which may again lead
to disasters on an even vaster scale. I feel that India can play a big part, and
perhaps an effective part, in helping to avoid war. Therefore, it becomes all
the more necessary that India should not be lined up with any group of
power which for various reasons are full of fear of war and prepare for
war”.
“When we say that India follows a policy of non-alignment, it means (i)
that India has no military alliances with countries of either bloc or indeed
with any nation; (ii) India has an independent approach to foreign policy;
and (iii) India attempts to maintain friendly relations with all countries”3
 .
5. Panchsheel
Panchsheel implies the five principles of conduct in international relations.
It was embodied in the Preamble of the Indo-China Treaty on Tibet, signed
in 1954 by Jawaharlal Nehru and Chou-En-Lai, the Chinese Premier. The
five principles were:
(i) mutual respect for each other’s territorial integrity and
sovereignty;
(ii) non-aggression;
(iii) non-interference in each other’s internal affairs;
(iv) equality and mutual benefit; and
(v) peaceful co-existence.
“India perceived the ‘Panchsheel’ as productive of peaceful cooperation
of sovereign nations instead of the balance of terror and the degrading cold
war tensions, being brought about by the rival great power pacts and
alliances. India explained it as based on the concept of universalism as
against the concept of the balance of power”4
 .
Panchsheel became very popular and many countries of the world like
Burma, Yugoslavia, Indonesia and so on adopted it. Panchsheel and nonalignment are the greatest contributions of India to the theory and practice
of international relations.
6. Afro-Asian Bias
Even though the foreign policy of India stands for maintaining friendly
relations with all the countries of the world, it has always exhibited a
special bias towards the Afro-Asian nations. It aims at promoting unity
among them and tries to secure for them a voice and an influence in the
international bodies. India has been seeking international assistance for the
economic development of these countries. In 1947, India called the first
Asian Relations Conference in New Delhi. In 1949, India brought together
the Asian countries on the burning issue of Indonesian freedom. India
played an active role in the Afro-Asian Conference at Bandung (Indonesia)
in 1955. India also played an important role in the formation of Group of 77
(1964), Group of 15 (1990), Indian Ocean Rim Association for Regional
Cooperation (1995), BIST Economic Cooperation (1997), and SAARC
(1985). India earned the name of ‘Big Brother’ from many of the
neighbouring countries.
7. Links with Commonwealth
In 1949 itself, India declared the continuation of her full membership of the
Commonwealth of the Nations and the acceptance of the British Crown as
the head of the Commonwealth. But, this extra-constitutional declaration
does not affect India’s sovereignty in any manner as the Commonwealth is a
voluntary association of independent nations. It also does not affect India’s
republican character as India neither pays final allegiance to the British
Crown nor the latter has any functions to discharge in relation to India.
India remained a member of the Commonwealth because of pragmatic
reasons. It thought that the membership in the Commonwealth would be
beneficial to her in the economic, political, cultural and other spheres. It has
been playing an important role at the CHOGM (Commonwealth Heads of
Governments Meet). India hosted the 24th Commonwealth Summit at New
Delhi in 1983.
8. Support to the UNO
India became a member of the UNO in 1945 itself. Since then, it has been
supporting the activities and programmes of UNO. It has expressed full
faith in the objectives and principles of UNO. Some of the facets of India’s
role in UNO are:
(i) It is through the UNO that India embarked on the policy of
fighting against the colonialism, imperialism and racialism, and
now neo-colonialism and neo-imperialism.
(ii) In 1953, Vijay Lakshmi Pandit of India was elected as the
President of the UN General Assembly.
(iii) India actively participated in the UN Peace-keeping missions in
Korea, Congo, El Salvador, Combodia, Angola, Somalia,
Mozambique, Sierra Leone, Yugoslavia and so on.
(iv) India continued to participate actively in the open ended working
groups of the UNO. India was the Co-chairman of the working
group on the strengthening of the UN which submitted its report
in 1997.
(v) Several times, India has been a nonpermanent member of the UN
Security Council. Now, India is demanding a permanent seat in
the Security Council.
9. Disarmament
The foreign policy of India is opposed to arms race and advocates
disarmament, both conventional and nuclear. This is aimed at promoting
world peace and security by reducing or ending tensions between power
blocs and to accelerate economic development of the country by preventing
the unproductive expenditure on the manufacture of arms. India has been
using the UNO platform to check the arms race and to achieve
disarmament. India took the initiative of holding a six-nation summit at
New Delhi in 1985 and made concrete proposals for nuclear disarmament.
By not signing the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) of 1968 and
the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) of 1996, India has kept its
nuclear options open. India opposes NPT and CTBT due to their
discriminatory and hegemonistic nature. They perpetuate an international
system in which only five nations (USA, Russia, China, UK and France)
can legitimately posses nuclear weapons.
OBJECTIVES OF INDIAN FOREIGN POLICY
India’s foreign policy is directed towards the realisation of the following

GUJRAL DOCTRINE OF INDIA
The Gujral Doctrine is a milestone in India’s foreign policy. It was
propounded and initiated in 1996 by I.K. Gujral, the then Foreign Minister
in the Deve Gowda Government.
The doctrine advocates that India, being the biggest country in South
Asia, should extend unilateral concessions to the smaller neighbours. In
other words, the doctrine is formulated on India’s accommodating approach
towards its smaller neighbours on the basis of the principle of nonreciprocity. It recognises the supreme importance of friendly and cordial
relations with India’s neighbours.
The doctrine is a five-point roadmap to guide the conduct of India’s
foreign relations with its immediate neighbours. These five principles are as
follows:
1.  With the neighbours like Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives, Nepal and
Sri Lanka, India should not ask for reciprocity, but give to them what it
can in good faith.
2.  No South Asian country should allow its territory to be used against
the interest of another country of the region.
3.  No country should interfere in the internal affairs of another
country.
4.  All South Asian countries should respect each other’s territorial
integrity and sovereignty.
5.  All South Asian countries should settle all their disputes through
peaceful bilateral negotiations.
Gujral himself explained: “The logic behind the Gujral Doctrine was that
since we had to face two hostile neighbours in the north and the west, we
had to be at ‘total peace’ with all other immediate neighbours in order to
contain Pakistan’s and China’s influence in the region.”
NUCLEAR DOCTRINE OF INDIA
India adopted its nuclear doctrine in 2003. The salient features of this
doctrine are as follows:
1.  Building and maintaining a credible minimum deterrent.
2.  A posture of “No First Use” - nuclear weapons will only be used in
retaliation against a nuclear attack on Indian territory or on Indian
forces anywhere.
3.  Nuclear retaliation to a first strike will be massive and designed to
inflict unacceptable damage.
4.  Nuclear retaliatory attacks can only be authorised by the civilian
political leadership through the Nuclear Command Authority.
5.  Non-use of nuclear weapons against nonnuclear weapon states.
6.  However, in the event of a major attack against India, or Indian
forces anywhere, by biological or chemical weapons, India will retain
the option of retaliating with nuclear weapons.
7.  A continuance of strict controls on export of nuclear and missile
related materials and technologies, participation in the Fissile Material
Cutoff Treaty negotiations, and continued observance of the
moratorium on nuclear tests.
8.  Continued commitment to the goal of a nuclear-weapon-free world,
through global, verifiable and non-discriminatory nuclear
disarmament.
The Nuclear Command Authority comprises a Political Council and an
Executive Council. The Political Council is chaired by the Prime Minister.
It is the sole body which can authorise the use of nuclear weapons.
The Executive Council is chaired by the National Security Advisor. It
provides inputs for decision making by the Nuclear Command Authority
and executes the directives given to it by the Political Council.
The Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) reviewed the progress in the
operationalising of India’s nuclear doctrine. The CCS reviewed the existing
command and control structures, the state of readiness, the targeting
strategy for a retaliatory attack, and operating procedures for various stages
of alert and launch. The CCS expressed satisfaction with the overall
preparedness.
The CCS approved the appointment of a Commander-in-Chief, Strategic
Forces Command, to manage and administer all Strategic Forces. The CCS
also reviewed and approved the arrangements for alternate chains of
command for retaliatory nuclear strikes in all eventualities.
CONNECT CENTRAL ASIA POLICY OF INDIA
India launched the “Connect Central Asia” Policy in 2012. This policy is
aimed at strengthening and expanding of India’s relations with the Central
Asian countries. These countries include Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan,
Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.
India’s “Connect Central Asia” policy is a broad-based approach
including political, security, economic and cultural connections. Its features
(or elements) are as follows6
 :
1.  India will continue to build on its strong political relations through
the exchange of high level visits. India’s leaders will continue to
interact closely both in bilateral and multilateral fora.
2.  India will strengthen its strategic and security cooperation. India
already has strategic partnerships with some Central Asian countries.
The focus will be on military training, joint research, counter-terrorism
coordination and close consultations on Afghanistan.
3.  India will step up multilateral engagement with Central Asian
partners using the synergy of joint efforts through existing fora like the
SCO, Eurasian Economic Community (EEC) and the Custom Union.
India has already proposed a Comprehensive Economic Cooperation
Agreement to integrate its markets with the unifying Eurasian space.
4.  India looks to Central Asia as a longterm partner in energy, and
natural resources. Central Asia possesses large cultivable tracts of land
and there is potential for India to cooperate in production of profitable
crops with value addition.
5.  The medical field is another area that offers huge potential for
cooperation. India is ready to extend cooperation by setting up civil
hospitals/clinics in Central Asia.
6.  India’s higher education system delivers at a fraction of the fees
charged by Western universities. Keeping this in mind, India would
like to assist in the setting up of a Central Asian University in Bishkek
that could come up as a centre of excellence to impart world class
education in areas like IT, management, philosophy and languages.
7.  India is working on setting up a Central Asian e-network with its
hub in India, to deliver, tele-education and tele-medicine connectivity,
linking all the five Central Asian States.
8.  Indian companies can showcase India’s capability in the
construction sector and build world class structures at competitive
rates. Central Asian countries, especially Kazakhstan, have almost
limitless reserves of iron ore and coal, as well as abundant cheap
electricity. India can help set up several medium size steel rolling
mills, producing its requirement of specific products.
9.  As for land connectivity, India has reactivated the International
North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC). There is a need to discuss
ways to bridge the missing links in the Corridor at the earliest and also
work on other connecting spurs along the route.
10.  Absence of a viable banking infrastructure in the region is a major
barrier to trade and investment. Indian banks can expand their presence
if they see a favourable policy environment.
11.  India and Central Asian nations will jointly work to improve air
connectivity between them. India is one of the biggest markets for
outbound travelers estimated at USD 21 billion in 2011. Many
countries have opened tourist offices in India to woo Indian tourists.
Central Asian countries could emerge as attractive holiday destinations
for tourists and even for the Indian film industry which likes to depict
exotic foreign locales in its films.
12.  Connections between the people are the most vital linkages to
sustain the deep engagement. There is particularly need to emphasise
exchanges between youth and the future leaders of India and Central
Asia. There is already a robust exchange of students. India and Central
Asian nations will encourage regular exchanges of scholars,
academics, civil society and youth delegations to gain deeper insights
into each other’s cultures.
India’s “Connect Central Asia” policy is consonant with its overall policy
of deepening engagement in Eurasia, its policy of strengthening relations
with China, with Pakistan, and building on its traditional relationship with
Russia. India hopes that its membership in numerous regional forums
including at the SCO, would bolster India’s renewed linkages with the
region.
ACT EAST POLICY OF INDIA
In 2014, the Modi Government upgraded India’s “Look East Policy” and renamed it as the “Act East Policy”. The “Look East Policy” was first
initiated in 1992 by the then Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao.
While addressing the India-ASEAN Summit (2014), the Prime Minister
Narendra Modi said : “A new era of economic development,
industrialization and trade has begun in India. Externally, India’s ‘Look
East Policy’ has become ‘Act East Policy’”. Similarly, the External Affairs
Minister Sushma Swaraj, during her visit to Vietnam in 2014, told Indian
envoys to ‘Act East’ and not just ‘Look East’.
The features (or elements) of India’s “Act East Policy” are as follows7
 :
1.  India’s Act East Policy focusses on the extended neighbourhood in
the Asia-Pacific region. The policy which was originally conceived as
an economic initiative, has gained political, strategic and cultural
dimensions including establishment of institutional mechanisms for
dialogue and cooperation.
2.  India has upgraded its relations to strategic partnership with
Indonesia, Vietnam, Malaysia, Japan, Republic of Korea, Australia,
Singapore and Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and
forged close ties with all countries in the Asia-Pacific region.
3.  Further, apart from ASEAN, ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) and
East Asia Summit (EAS), India has also been actively engaged in
regional fora such as Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral
Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC), Asia Cooperation
Dialogue (ACD), Mekong Ganga Cooperation (MGC) and Indian
Ocean Rim Association (IORA).
4.  Act East Policy has placed emphasis on India-ASEAN cooperation
in our domestic agenda on infrastructure, manufacturing, trade, skills,
urban renewal, smart cities, Make in India and other initiatives.
Connectivity projects, cooperation in space, S&T and people-to-people
exchanges could become a springboard for regional integration and
prosperity.
5.  The objective of ‘’Act East Policy” is to promote economic
cooperation, cultural ties and develop strategic relationship with
countries in the Asia-Pacific region through continuous engagement at
bilateral, regional and multilateral levels thereby providing enhanced
connectivity to the States of North Eastern Region including
Arunanchal Pradesh with other countries in our neighbourhood.
6.  The North East of India has been a priority in our Act East Policy.
The policy provides an interface between North East India including
the state of Arunachal Pradesh and the ASEAN region.
7.  Various plans at bilateral and regional levels include steady efforts
to develop and strengthen connectivity of Northeast with the ASEAN
region through trade, culture, people-to-people contacts and physical
infrastructure (road, airport, telecommunication, power, etc.).
8.  On the Civilizational front, Buddhist and Hindu links are being
energized to develop new contacts and connectivity between people.
9.  On Connectivity, special efforts are being made to develop a
coherent strategy, particularly for linking ASEAN with North East
India. Measures, including building transport infrastructure,
encouraging airlines to enhance connectivity in the region, contacts
between academic and cultural institutions are underway.
10.  India’s economic engagement with ASEAN has been stepped up -
regional integration and implementation of projects are priorities. The
ASEAN-India Agreement on Trade in Service and Investments has
entered into force for India and seven ASEAN countries from 1 July
2015.
11.  On strategic issues, India has increased convergence on security
interests with key partners both in bilateral and multilateral format.
Closer cooperation in combating terrorism, collaborating for peace and
stability in the region and promotion of maritime security based on
international norms and laws are being pursued.

PART-XI
WORKING OF THE CONSTITUTION
80. National Commission to Review the Working of the Constitution
80 National Commission to Review
the Working of the Constitution
The National Commission to Review the Working of the Constitution
(NCRWC) was set up by a resolution of the Government of India in 20001
.
The 11-member Commission was headed by M.N. Venkatachaliah, the
former Chief Justice of India2
. It submitted its report in 20023
 .
I. TERMS OF REFERENCE OF THE COMMISSION
According to the terms of reference, the commission was required to
examine, in the light of the experience of the past fifty years, as to how far
the existing provisions of the Constitution are capable of responding to the
needs of efficient, smooth and effective system of governance and
socioeconomic development of modern India and to recommend changes, if
any. The terms of reference clearly specified that the commission should
recommend changes that are required to be made in the Constitution within
the framework of parliamentary democracy and without interfering with the
‘basic structure’ or ‘basic features’ of the Constitution.
The commission clarified that its task was to review the working of the
Constitution and not to rewrite it and its function was only recommendatory
and advisory in nature. It was left to the Parliament to accept or reject any
of the recommendations.
The commission had no agenda before it. On its own, it identified the
eleven areas of study and proposed to examine them. They included the
following4
 :
1.  Strengthening of the institutions of parliamentary democracy
(working of the Legislature, the Executive and the Judiciary; their
accountability; problems of administrative, social and economic cost
of political instability; exploring the possibilities of stability within the
discipline of parliamentary democracy).
2.  Electoral reforms; standards in political life.
3.  Pace of socio-economic change and development under the
Constitution (assurance of social and economic rights: how fair? how
fast? how equal?).
4.  Promoting literacy; generating employment; ensuring social
security; alleviation of poverty.
5.  Union-State relations.
6.  Decentralization and devolution; empowerment and strengthening
of Panchayati Raj Institutions.
7.  Enlargement of Fundamental Rights.
8.  Effectuation of Fundamental Duties.
9.  Effectuation of Directive Principles and achievement of the
Preambular objectives of the Constitution.
10.  Legal control of fiscal and monetary policies; public audit
mechanism.
11.  Administrative system and standards in public life.
II. FIFTY YEARS OF WORKING OF THE
CONSTITUTION
The observations made by the Commission on the working of the
Constitution from 1950 to 2000 are as follows5
 :
What are our achievements and failures over the 50 years since
Independence? How have each of the three organs of the State–the
Legislature, the Executive and the Judiciary– redeemed the constitutional
pledge of ushering in a social revolution? Has the dream of the founding
fathers for a life of dignity to the vast millions through the process of
socioeconomic transformation been realized ? What then is the Balance
Sheet?
1. Political Accomplishments
1.  India’s democratic base has stabilized as a working federal polity.
With the 73rd and 74th Constitutional amendments, the base of
democratic debate has widened. There is greater push towards
noncentralisation. General Elections have been held with regularity;
and transfers of power consequent upon the results of elections have
been orderly, peaceful and democratic.
2.  The educational qualifications of the Members of Parliament and
State Legislatures have shown marked improvements. The Parliament
and State Legislatures are increasingly more representative of the
composition of society. More and more members of the hitherto
backward classes are moving up in the political ladder.
2. Economic Infrastructure–Impressive Performance
1.  There has been marked expansion and diversification of production.
New technologies and modern management techniques are
increasingly employed. There are marked advances in Science,
Technology, Medicine, Engineering and Information Technology.
2.  Between 1950–2000, the index of agricultural production increased
from 46.2 to 176.8.
3.  Between 1960–2000, wheat production went up from 11 million
tonnes to 75.6 million tonnes.
4.  Between 1960–2000, rice production went up from 35 million
tonnes to 89.5 million tonnes.
5.  Impressive expansion of industrial and service sectors has taken
place.
6.  Index of industrial production went up from 7.9 in 1950–51 to
154.7 in 1999–2000.
7.  Electricity generation has increased from 5.1 billion KWH in 1950–
51 to 480.7 billion KWH in 1999–2000.
8.  6 to 8 per cent annual growth of GNP between 1994–2000 (except
in 1997–98) was achieved.
9.  Revenues from Information Technology industry have grown from
$ 150 million in 1990 to $ 4 billion in 1999.
10.  India’s per capita Net National Product (NNP) in 1999–2000 was
more than 2.75 times than what it was in 1951.
3. Social Infrastructure– Achievements
1.  Between 1950 to 1998, infant mortality rate have halved to 72
births per 1000 births–down from 146.
2.  Life expectancy at birth has grown up from 32 years in 1950–51 to
63 years in 2000.
3.  A child born in Kerala today can expect to live longer than a child
born in Washington.
4.  Life expectancy of women in Kerala is now 75 years.
5.  India has put in place an extensive system of Public Health Services
and medical network. In 1951, the country had only 725 primary
health centers. By 1995, this has increased to more than 1,50,000.
6.  The number of primary schools has increased significantly between
1951 and 1995 from 2,10,000 to 5,90,000.
7.  Nearly 95 per cent of the villages have a primary school within a
walking distance of one kilometer.
4. Political Failures
1.  The main cause and source of politicaldecay is the ineptness of the
electoral process which has not been able to keep out criminal, antisocial and undesirable elements from participating in and even
dominating the political scene and polluting the electoral and
parliamentary processes.
2.  Though democratic traditions are stabilizing, however, democracy
cannot be said to be an inclusive representative democracy. The
pluralism and diversity of India is not reflected in and captured by its
democratic institutions; likewise, participation of women in public
affairs and decision-making processes is nowhere near proportionate to
their numbers.
3.  The enormity of the costs of elections and electoral corruption have
been having a grievous deleterious effect on national progress and has
led to the degradation of political processes to detriment of common
good.
4.  Political parties, which have a fair share of the criminal elements,
handle enormous funds collected ostensibly for meeting party and
electoral expenditure. Money-power and criminal elements have
contributed to pervasive degeneration of standards in public life and
have criminalized politics. This is reflected in the quality of
governments and of the governing processes.
5.  There are no legal instrumentalities or set of law regulating the
conduct of the political parties, legitimacy of fundraising, audit and
account requirements and inner-party democracy.
6.  National political parties are more divided on the definition of
‘common national purpose’ than ever before; the noble purposes of
public life have degenerated than ever before into opportunistic and
self-seeking politics of competitive personal gain.
7.  ‘Fraternity’, the noble ideal of brotherhood of man, enshrined in the
Preamble of the Constitution has remained unrealized. The people of
India are more divided amongst themselves than at the time of the
country’s independence.
8.  There is increasing criminalization and exploitation of the political
climate and processes and an increasing criminals-politiciansbureaucratic nexus.
9.  There is crisis of confidence. There is crisis of leadership. Political
leaders, owing to narrow partisan and sectarian interests and desire for
short-time political gains, are unable even to agree upon broad
common national purposes.
5. Economic Failures
1.  The richest top quintile of population has 85 per cent of the income.
The poorest quintile has only 1.5 per cent of the country’s income. The
second, the third and the fourth quintile from top have respectively 8
per cent, 3.5 per cent and 2 per cent of the income.
2.  260 million people live below the poverty line.
6. Social Failures
1.  India’s maternal mortality rate in 1998 was 407 per 100,000 live
births. These levels are more than 100 times the levels found in the
West.
2.  Some 53 per cent children (almost 60 million) under five remain
malnour-ished–nearly twice the levels reported in many parts of subSaharan Africa.
3.  The proportion of low birth weight babies born in India is 33 per
cent. It is only 9 per cent in China and South Korea, 6 per cent in
Thailand and 8 per cent in Indonesia.
4.  India was a signatory to the Alma Ata Declaration in 1978 that
assured ‘health for all’ by the year 2000. Only 42 per cent of the
children between 12–23 months are fully immunized - 37 per cent in
rural areas and 61 per cent in urban areas. The coverage is shockingly
low in Bihar - 11 per cent and in Rajasthan - 17 per cent.
5.  While per capita daily consumption of cereals has improved only
marginally from 400 gms in 1950 to about 440 gms in 2000, the per
capita pulses (protein intake) have over the 50 years decreased.
6.  The promise of social revolution has remained unredeemed. There
are 270 million Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and the
measures for their welfare and uplift have not been implemented with
sincerity.
7.  There are 380 million children below the age of 14. Almost 100
million of them are Dalit children. No effective steps are taken to bring
them to the level of the “core-mainstream”.
8.  Population control measures in the northern States have not
succeeded. Fertility rates in Uttar Pradesh indicate that the State is
almost a century behind Kerala.
7. Administrative Failures
1.  Corruption, insensitivity and inefficiency of administration have
resulted in extralegal systems and parallel economies and even parallel
governments. Bureaucratic corruption, which cause frustration in
people in their daily lives, has pushed more and more people into
extralegal systems. The mal-administration has resulted in a lack of
faith in and disenchantment with institutions of democracy.
2.  There is an increasing non-accountability. Corruption has been
pervasive. Public interest has suffered.
3.  Constitutional protection for the Services under Article 311 has
largely been exploited by dishonest officials to protect themselves
from the consequences of their wrong-doings.
8. Gender Justice and Equality– Failures
1.  The regional disparities in life expectancy is indicated by the fact
that a woman born in Kerala can expect to live 18 years longer than
one born in Madhya Pradesh.
2.  In most countries life expectancy among women exceeds that of
men by about 5 years. In all but a few countries of the world, there are
typically 1005 women for every 1000 men. Men outnumber women
only in societies where women are specifically and systematically
discriminated. In India, there are only 933 women for every 1000 men.
This is the phenomenon about ‘missing’ women.
3.  Overall representation of women in public services is just 4.9 per
cent.
4.  Political participation of women indicates that in 1952 there were
only 22 women in Lok Sabha against 499 seats (4.41 per cent). In
1991, this increased to 49 seats as against 544 seats (9.02 per cent).
5.  Between 1995–2000, out of 503 judges of the High Court, only 15
were women.
9. Judicial System–Failures
1.  Judicial system has not been able to meet even the modest
expectations of the society. Its delays and costs are frustrating, its
processes slow and uncertain.
2.  People are pushed to seek recourse to extra-legal methods for relief.
3.  Trial system both on the civil and criminal side has utterly broken
down.
On an overall assessment, there are more failures than success stories,
making the inference inescapable that the fifty years of the working of the
Constitution is substantially a saga of missed opportunities.
III. AREAS OF CONCERN: COMMISSION’S
PERCEPTION
The following are the important areas of concern according to the
perception of the Commission6
 :
1.  There is a fundamental breach of the constitutional faith on the part
of Governments and their method of governance lies in the neglect of
the people who are the ultimate source of all political authority. Public
servants and institutions are not alive to the basic imperative that they
are servants of the people meant to serve them. The dignity of the
individual enshrined in the Constitution has remained an unredeemed
pledge. There is, thus, a loss of faith in the Governments and
governance. Citizens see their Governments besieged by
uncontrollable events and are losing faith in institutions. Society is
unable to cope up with current events.
2.  The foremost area of concern is the present nature of the Indian
State and its inability to anticipate and provide for the great global
forces of change ushered in by the pace of scientific and technological
developments.
3.  The next and equally important dimension is the increasing cost of
government and fiscal deficits which are alarming. In 1947, there was
a deficit of ₹2 crores in the revenue budget; in 1997–98, it became
₹88,937 crores; in 2001–02, it is about ₹1,16,000 crores (4.8 per cent
of GDP). India is on its way to a debt-trap.
4.  There is pervasive impurity of the political climate and of political
activity. Criminalisation of politics, politicalcorruption and the
politician-criminal-bureaucratic nexus have reached unprecedented
levels needing strong systemic changes.
5.  Issues of national integrity and security have not received adequate
and thoughtful attention. Mechanisms for the assessment of early
warning symptoms of social unrest are absent. Mechanisms for
adequate and immediate state responses to emergencies and disaster
management are wholly inadequate. Administration, as a system for
anticipating coming events and planning responses in advance, has
failed. It has become un-coordinated and directionless amalgam of
different departments often with over-lapping and even mutually
conflicting jurisdictions, powers and responsibilities which merely acts
as a reaction to problems. There are no clear-cut standards or basis for
fixing responsibilities.
6.  Though India’s overall record and experience as a working
democracy (despite many centrifugal forces) are worthy to mention
and though the bases of democratic debate have widened with the 73rd
and 74th Constitutional amendments, the working of the institutions of
parliamentary democracy, however, have thrown-up serious fault-lines,
which might, if unattended, prove destructive of the basic democratic
values.
7.  There is pervasive misuse of the electoral process and the electoral
system is unable to prevent the entry of persons with criminal record
into the portal of law-making institutions.
8.  The Parliament and the State Legislatures, owing to the inherent
weakness of the electoral system, have failed to acquire adequate
representative character. The 13th Lok Sabha represents only 27.9 per
cent of the total electorate and the Legislature of U.P. represents only
22.2 per cent of electorate respectively.
9.  The increasing instability of the elected governments is attributable
to opportunistic politics and unprincipled defections. The economic
and administrative costs of political instability are unaf-fordably high
and their impact on the polity is not clearly comprehended and
realized. Though just four Prime Ministers ruled the country for 40
years out of the 54 years of independence and one political party alone
was in power for 45 years, however, 1989 onwards the country saw
five General Elections to the Lok Sabha. Costs of this political
instability are simply colossal.
10.  The state of the Indian economy is disturbing. The economy is
gradually sinking into a debt-trap. Economic, fiscal and monetary
policies, coupled with administrative inefficiency, corruption and
wasteful expenditure are increasingly pushing the society into extralegal systems, crime-syndicates, mob-rule and hoodlum out-fits.
Black-money, parallel economy and even parallel governments are the
overarching economic and social realities. Legitimate governments
will, in due course, find it increasingly difficult to confront them. In
course of time these illegal criminal out-fits will dictate terms to the
legitimate governments.
11.  Rural de-population, urbanization, urban-congestion and social
unrest need immediate attention and solutions. Increasing
unemployment will prove a serious threat to orderly government.
12.  Future of society is increasingly knowledge-based and knowledgedriven. The quality of education and the higher research need urgent
repair. The country is engaged in a unilateral and unthinking
educational disarmament.
13.  System of administration of justice in the country is another area
of concern.
14.  Criminal justice system is on the verge of collapse. The quality of
investigations and prosecutions requires a strong second look. Law’s
delay and costs of litigation have become proverbial. Victimology,
victim-protection and protection of witnesses in sensitive criminaltrials need institutional arrangements. Recruitment, training, refresher
and continuing legal education for lawyers, judges and judicial
administrators need immediate attention. The increasing utilization of
alternative dispute resolution mechanisms such as mediation,
conciliation and arbitration as well as mechanisms of auxiliary
adjudicative services need to be stressed.
15.  Communal and other inter-group riots in a country like India with
its religious, social and cultural diversity cannot be treated as merely
law and order problem. They are manifestations of collective
behavioural disorders. Legal and administrative measures are required
to be taken to remove the insecurity felt by the minorities and for
bringing them into the mainstream of the national fabric.
16.  The state of social infrastructure is disturbing. There are 380
million children below the age of 14. The arrangements for their
education, health and well-being are wholly inadequate both
qualitatively and quantitatively. 96.4 per cent of the primary education
budget goes for salaries alone.
17.  Rates of infant mortality, blindness, maternal mortality, maternalanemia, child malnutrition and child-immunization, despite significant
progress achieved, yet remain at high and disconcerting levels.
18.  Public health and hygiene have not received adequate attention.
There is alarming increase of infectious diseases such as Tuberculosis,
Malaria, Hepatitis, HIV etc.
IV. RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE COMMISSION
In all, the commission made 249 recommendations. Of them, 58
recommendations involve amendments to the Constitution, 86 involve
legislative measures and the remaining 105 recommendations could be
accomplished through executive action.
The various recommendations of the commission are mentioned below in
an area-wise manner7

detention should be six months; and (ii) the advisory board should
consist of a chairman and two other members and they should be
serving judges of any high court.
6.  Sikhism, Jainism and Buddhism should be treated as religions
separate from Hinduism and the provisions grouping them together
(under Article 25) should be deleted. At present, the word ‘Hindu’ is

free and independent functioning of Parliament and state legislatures.
2.  Article 105 may be amended to clarify that the immunity enjoyed
by members under parliamentary privileges does not cover corrupt acts
committed by them in connection with their duties in the House or
otherwise. Further, no court would take cognizance of any offence

the Speaker / Chairman. Article 194 may also be similarly amended in
relation to the members of state legislatures.
3.  The domiciliary requirement for eligibility to contest elections to
Rajya Sabha from the concerned state should be maintained. This is
essential to ensure the federal character of the Rajya Sabha.
4.  The MP local area development scheme should be discontinued.

days. Similarly, the minimum number of days for sittings of Rajya
Sabha and Lok Sabha should be fixed at 100 and 120 days
respectively.
12.  A Study Group outside Parliament for study of procedural reforms
should be set up.
6. On Executive and Administration
1.  In case of hung Parliament, the Lok Sabha may elect the leader of
the House. He may then be appointed as the prime minister by the
president. The same procedure could be followed at the state level
also.
2.  A motion of no-confidence against a prime minister must be
accompanied by a proposal of alternative leader to be voted
simultaneously. This is called as the ‘system of constructive vote of no
confidence’.
3.  For a motion of no-confidence to be brought out against the
government, at least 20 per cent of the total number of members of the
House should give notice.
4.  The practice of having oversized Council of Ministers should be
prohibited by law. A ceiling on the number of Ministers in any State or
the Union government be fixed at the maximum of 10 per cent of the
total strength of the popular house of the legislature.

position, perks and privileges of a minister should be discouraged.
Their number should be limited to 2 per cent of the total strength of the
lower house.

the prime minister outside its purview and the institution of lokayuktas
in the states.

an oath of loyalty to the Constitution, should swear to abide by the
principles of good governance.
11.  Right to information should be guaranteed and the traditional
insistence on secrecy should be discarded. In fact, there should be an
oath of transparency in place of an oath of secrecy.
12.  Public Interest Disclosure Acts (which are popularly called the
Whistle-blower Acts) may be enacted to fight corruption and maladministration.
13.  A law should be enacted to provide for forfeiture of benami

there should be a time-limit (say of three months) within which the
President should take a decision whether to give his assent or to return
the bill.
8. On Judiciary

restructured in a manner that creates a separate fiscal domain for
panchayats and municipalities.
2.  State panchayat council should be established under the
chairmanship of the chief minister.
3.  Panchayats and Municipalities should be categorically declared to

be suitably amended.
4.  The Election Commission of India should have the power to issue
directions to the State Election Commission for the discharge of its
functions. The State Election Commission should submit its annual or
special reports to the Election Commission of India and to the
Governor. This requires the amendment of Articles 243-K and 243-
ZA.
5.  Article 243-E should be amended to the effect that a reasonable
opportunity of being heard shall be given to a Panchayat before it is
dissolved.

should be vested in a Delimitation Commission and not in the State
Election Commission.
10.  The concept of a distinct and separate tax domain for
municipalities should be recognized.
11. On Institutions in North East India
1.  Efforts are to be made to give all the States in this region the

Amendments. However, this should be done with due regard to the
unique political traditions of the region.
2.  The subjects given under the Sixth Schedule and those mentioned
in the Eleventh Schedule could be entrusted to the Autonomous
District Councils (ADCs).
3.  Traditional forms of governance should be associated with selfgovernance because of the present dissatisfaction.

imprisonment for a maximum term of five years or more, should be
disqualified for being chosen as or for being a member of Parliament
or Legislature of a State.
2.  Any person convicted for any heinous crime like murder, rape,
smuggling, dacoity, etc., should be permanently debarred from
contesting for any political office.
3.  Criminal cases against politicians pending before Courts either for
trial or in appeal must be disposed of speedily, if necessary, by
appointing Special Courts.
4.  The election petitions should also be decided by special courts. In
the alternative, special election benches may be constituted in the High
Courts and earmarked exclusively for the disposal of election petitions
and election disputes.
5.  Any system of State funding of elections bears a close nexus to the
regulation of working of political parties by law and to the creation of
a foolproof mechanism under law with a view to implementing the
financial limits strictly. Therefore, proposals for State funding should
be deferred till these regulatory mechanisms are firmly in position.
6.  Candidates should not be allowed to contest election
simultaneously for the same office from more than one constituency.
7.  The election code of conduct should be given the sanctity of law
and its violation should attract penal action.
8.  The Commission while recognizing the beneficial potential of the
system of run off contest electing the representative winning on the
basis of 50 per cent plus one vote polled, as against the present firstpast-the-post system, for a more representative democracy,
recommends that the Government and the Election Commission of
India should examine this issue of prescribing a minimum of 50 per
cent plus one vote for election in all its aspects.
9.  An independent candidate who loses election three times
consecutively should be permanently debarred from contesting
election to the same office.
10.  The minimum number of valid votes polled should be increased to
25 per cent from the current 16.67 per cent as a condition for the
deposit not being forfeited.
11.  The issue of eligibility of non-Indian born citizens or those whose
parents or grandparents were citizens of India to hold high offices in
the realm such as President, Vice-President, Prime Minister and Chief
Justice of India should be examined in depth through a political
process after a national dialogue10
 .
12.  The Chief Election Commissioner and the other Election
Commissioners should be appointed on the recommendation of a body
consisting of the Prime Minister, Leader of the Opposition in the Lok
Sabha, Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, the Speaker of the
Lok Sabha and the Deputy Chairman of the Rajya Sabha. Similar
procedure should be adopted in the case of appointment of State
Election Commissioners.
13. On Political Parties
1.  A comprehensive law regulating the registration and functioning of
political parties or alliances of parties should be made. The proposed
law should-
(a)  provide that political party or alliance should keep its doors open
to all citizens irrespective of any distinctions of caste, community or
the like.
(b)  make it compulsory for the parties to maintain accounts of the
receipt of funds and expenditure in a systematic and regular way.
(c)  make it compulsory for the political parties requiring their
candidates to declare their assets and liabilities at the time of filing
their nomination.
(d)  provide that no political party should provide ticket to a candidate
if he was convicted by any court for any criminal offence or if the
courts have framed criminal charges against him.
(e)  specifically provide that if any party violates the above provision ,
the candidate involved should be liable to be disqualified and the party
deregistered and derecognized.
2.  The Election Commission should progressively increase the
threshold criterion for eligibility for recognition so that the
proliferation of smaller political parties is discouraged.
3.  A comprehensive legislation providing for regulation of
contributions to the political parties and towards election expenses
should be enacted by consolidating such laws. This new law should:
(a)  aim at bringing transparency into political funding;
(b)  permit corporate donations within higher prescribed limits;
(c)  make donations up to a specified limit tax exempt;
(d)  make both donors and donees of political funds accountable;
(e)  provide that audited political party accounts should be published
yearly; and
(f)  provide for de-recognition of the party and enforcement of
penalties for filing false election returns.
14. On Anti-Defection Law
The provisions of the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution should be
amended to provide the following:
1.  All persons defecting (whether individually or in groups) from the
party or the alliance of parties, on whose ticket they had been elected,
must resign from their parliamentary or assembly seats and must
contest fresh elections.
2.  The defectors should be debarred to hold any public office of a
minister or any other remunerative political post for at least the
duration of the remaining term of the existing legislature or until the
next elections whichever is earlier.
3.  The vote cast by a defector to topple a government should be
treated as invalid.
4.  The power to decide questions regarding disqualification on ground
of defection should vest in the Election Commission instead of in the
Speaker / Chairman of the House concerned.
V. EARLIER EFFORTS TO REVIEW THE
CONSTITUTION
Even before the appointment of this Commission in 2000, certain attempts
were already made to review the working of the Constitution. The
Commission itself has summarized those attempts in the following way
11
:
1.  There was nothing entirely new in the effort at reviewing the
working of our Constitution. The debate had continued right from the
first decade of the life of the Constitution. Also, every amendment had
been an occasion for review. But, in the half-a-century and more since
the Constitution came into force, whereas as many as eighty-five
amendments have been instituted, there has been (till the setting up of
the National Commission to Review the Working of the Constitution)
no comprehensive and transparent official exercise to review the
working of the Constitution in its entirety with a view to evaluating its
achievements and failures in fulfilling the objectives of the
Constitution in the context of experience gained, and for future
requirements perceived.
2.  After the Constitution came into force, within two years, it was
required to be amended. In the course of his speech on the Constitution
(First Amendment) Bill, 1951, on 2 June 1951 Nehru once again
repeated his views as to the need for the Constitution to be amenable to
amendment. On this occasion, his words were trenchant and unsparing.
He said:
“A Constitution which is unchanging and static, it does not matter
how good it is, but as a Constitution it is past its use. It is in its
old age already and gradually approaching its death. A
Constitution to be living must be growing; must be adaptable;
must be flexible; must be changeable... Therefore, it is a desirable
and a good thing for people to realize that this very fine
Constitution that we have fashioned after years of labour, is good
in so far as it goes, but as society changes as conditions change,
we amend it in the proper way”.
3.  Four years later, as an experienced Prime Minister with prolonged
firsthand knowledge of the efficacy of the fundamental law of the land,
he held the same view. Speaking on the Constitution (Fourth
Amendment) Bill, 1955 Nehru said:
“After all, the Constitution is meant to facilitate the working of
the Government and the administrative and other structures of this
country. It is meant to be not something that is static and which
has a static form in a changing world, but something which has
something dynamic in it, which takes cognizance of the dynamic
nature of modern conditions, modern society.”
4.  In the years that followed the Fourth Amendment, the Constitution
has been amended 81 times. The Union and the State Governments
and Parliament faced the Supreme Court over fundamental rights
issues: freedom of expression visa-vis national integrity; personal
liberty visa-vis political stability; special treatment for some segments
of society visa-vis abstract equality for all; property rights vis-a-vis
social revolution needs etc. Questions also arose whether the power of
constitutional amendment was complete, unrestrained and unlimited
and whether there were limits to the power of judicial review of
constitutional amendments.
5.  In the period 1950 to 1967, Parliament and most State Assemblies
had preponderant Congress majorities. General Elections in 1967 were
followed by the formation of non-Congress coalitions in a number of
States in the northern region of the country. Certain issues pertaining
to Union-State relations arose during this period directly from the
functioning of mechanisms and processes under the Constitution. An
Administrative Reforms Commission was constituted by the
Government of India to examine administrative aspects of Union-State
relations.
6.  In the period following the fourth General Election, the
phenomenon of unprincipled defections for money or ministerships
etc. came to the fore: legislators changing their party allegiance again
and again in utter disregard of all moral and political proprieties,
constituency choice and public opinion. Wide-spread concern about
the problem was mirrored in Parliament, and led to a unanimous
resolution in the Lok Sabha on 8 December 1967. The resolution read:
“This House is of opinion that a high-level Committee consisting
of representatives of political parties and constitutional experts be
set up immediately by Government to consider the problem of
legislators changing their allegiance from one party to another
and their frequent crossing of the floor in all its aspects, and make
recommendations in this regard.”
7.  Known subsequently as the Y.B. Chavan Committee, after the then
Union Home Minister who was the Chairman of the Committee, this
body produced a valuable report which addressed a variety of issues
germane to the handling of the problem of defections which had basic
implications with reference to the working of constitutional machinery
and connected statutory and procedural instrumentalities.
8.  The 25th anniversary of the coming into force of the Constitution of
the world’s largest democratic republic occurred, ironically, in the year
in which the Emergency was clamped on the nation in an atmosphere
of burgeoning national unrest. It was in this context that the first
concerted initiative towards a review and revision of the Constitution
was undertaken in 1975. At the AICC Session in December, 1975 - the
‘Kamagata Maru Session’ -a resolution on the political situation stated:
“If the misery of the poor and vulnerable sections of our society is
to be alleviated, vast and far-reaching changes have to be effected
in our socio-economic structure... The Congress urges that our
Constitution be thoroughly examined in order to ascertain if the
time has not come to make adequate alterations to it so that it may
continue as a living document.”
9.  A document titled ‘A Fresh Look at Our Constitution - Some
Suggestions’ surfaced at this time and was circulated but, after the
recommendations contained in it had drawn stringent criticism from
diverse quarters, it was not pursued. Amidst tenacious advocacy about
the need for constitutional change, particularly after the Kamagata
Maru Session of the Indian National Congress, the then Congress
President, D.K. Borooah appointed, on 26 February 1976, a
Committee “to study the question of amendment of the Constitution..
in the light of experience.” The twelve-member Committee, headed by
Sardar Swaran Singh, submitted “tentative proposals” to the Congress
President in April 1976 and these were then circulated among a select
few. The then Chairman of the Law Commission of India, Justice P.B.
Gajendragadkar wrote to the Prime Minister that while amendment to
the Constitution was necessary to expedite the socio-economic
revolution, “ad-hocism is undesirable and adoption of extremist
doctrinaire positions is irrelevant and inadvisable”. He advised the
Prime Minister “to appoint a high powered committee to research and
discuss the problem in depth for a dedicated and comprehensive
effort.”
10.  The Swaran Singh Committee Report stated that its
recommendations had been made with the background of the tentative
proposals circulated earlier to Congress Chief Ministers and Pradesh
Congress Committees, the views of Bar Associations of the Supreme
Court and all the High Courts, comments in the Press and in public and
memoranda and opinions received from individuals, professional
bodies etc. It said:
“.....the Committee has kept before it certain important objectives.
Our Constitution has functioned without any serious impediment
during the past 26 years or so. While this is so, difficulties have
been thrown up from time to time in the interpretation of some of
its provisions, more particularly when they concern the right of
Parliament to be the most authentic and effective instrument to
give expression and content to the sovereign will of the people”.
The Committee also declared that:
“The Parliamentary system is best suited to our country, and it is
unnecessary to abandon it in favour of the Presidential or any
other system. In a vast country like India, with the kind of
regional diversity as we have, the Parliamentary system preserves
best the unity and integrity of the country and ensures greater
responsiveness to the voice of the people.”
11.  The Committee made a series of recommendations on a wide
range of issues including the Preamble; the Directive Principles; the
constituent power of Parliament to amend the Constitution; the power
of judicial review; article 276; service matters; industrial and labour
disputes; matters relating to revenue, land reform, procurement and
distribution of food grains and other essential commodities; Election
matters; Article 227; disqualification for membership of a house of
Parliament or either house of the State Legislature; article 352 and
Union State Coordination. The Committee also undertook to make
separate proposals for the deletion of some provisions of the
Constitution which, it observed, had become “obsolete or redundant.”
12.  Reacting to the Swaran Singh Committee and its report as
published, Justice P.B. Gajendragadkar, then still the Chairman of the
Law Commission, in a letter to Smt. Indira Gandhi, reiterated his view
that the amendment to the fundamental law of the land should not have
been left to a party committee and that the modality could, advisedly,
have been a committee of experts to hear all parties and persons. He
said, further, that the Committee appointed by Congress President
Borooah had “worked in a hurry, discussed issues in a casual manner
and based its recommendations mainly on political considerations.”
13.  When the Forty-Second Amendment Bill was prepared, the
Statement of Objects and Reasons echoed some of Jawaharlal Nehru’s
words. “A Constitution to be living must be growing”, it declared. “If
the impediments to the growth of the Constitution are not removed, the
Constitution will suffer virtual atrophy.” The Prime Minister, in her
speech in the Lok Sabha on 27 October 1976, said that the purpose of
the Bill was “to remedy the anomalies that have long been noticed and
to overcome obstacles put up by economic and political vested
interests,” and that the Bill was “responsive to the aspirations of the
people, and reflects the realities of the present time and the future”.
14.  After the change of Government, following general elections in
1977, the then Prime Minister, Morarji Desai appointed a Committee
of Members of Parliament as a forum for considering substantive
changes in the amendments brought about during the Emergency.
Subsequently, the Prime Minister set up a Sub-Committee of the
Cabinet for the same purpose. Issues germane to the 42nd Amendment
were subject matter of voluminous expression of opinion by jurists,
parliamentarians, editors and professional bodies. But, essentially, the
effort focused on the correction of the imbalance in the Constitution
caused by some provisions of the Forty Second Amendment.
15.  The need was felt for a comprehensive review of Union-State
relations following the experience gained in the period after the
General Elections of 1977 which had resulted in non Congress
governments at the Centre and in several major States in the north, but
governments formed by the Congress in the southern States. In 1983, a
Commission was constituted under the chairmanship of Justice R.S.
Sarkaria with fairly wide-ranging terms of reference. These included:
“(i)  The Commission will examine and review the working of the
existing arrangements between the Union and the States in regard to
powers, functions and responsibilities in all spheres and recommend
such changes or other measures as may be appropriate;
(ii)  In examining and reviewing the working of existing arrangements
between the Union and States and making recommendations as to
changes and measures needed, the Commission will keep in view the
social and economic developments that have taken place over the years
and have due regard to the scheme and framework of the Constitution
which the founding fathers have so sedulously designed to protect the
independence and ensure the unity and integrity of the country which
is of paramount importance for promoting the welfare of the people.”
16.  There were also some other especially note-worthy studies of
particular problems in the political system. Deep concern had been
voiced relative to flaws in the electoral process. This had occasioned a
Joint Parliamentary Committee on Amendments to Election Law,
which submitted its report in 1972. The Committee for Democracy set
up by Loknayak Jaya Prakash Narayan had also studied the subject.
Various aspects of electoral reforms were reviewed by a Cabinet Sub
Committee appointed in 1977 and another in 1982. In 1990, the
Government of India constituted a Committee under the Chairmanship
of the then Union Law Minister Dinesh Goswami with Members
drawn from different political parties. The Report of the Committee
contained a series of recommendations, most of which were accepted
for implementation.
17.  A Committee to examine issues related to State Funding of
Elections was constituted in May 1998, known as the Indrajit Gupta
Committee after that outstanding Parliamentarian and leader who was
its Chairman. Although the Committee had a relatively limited
compass of study, its observations are noteworthy and comprise
valuable supplementary material pertaining to the process of elections.
18.  Various Reports of the Law Commission of India provide a wealth
of insights into the working of the machinery of the Constitution. The
170th Report of the Law Commission, on Reform of Election Laws,
presented in May 1999, considers radical approaches seeking to
improve the system of elections - the very sheet anchor of
Parliamentary Democracy under the Constitution.
19.  The most significant of the non-political civil society efforts was
the seminar organised by 15 national institutions in 1992 and the
committee appointed by the India International Centre to review the
working of the Constitution. The committee which had the senior
Congress leader and former cabinet minister, Dr. Karan Singh as the
Chairman and included among its members two of the members of this
Commission, presented its report to the President and others.
Concluding recommendation of the committee was that of a Review
Commission being appointed.
20.  The National Agenda for Governance issued by the National
Democratic Alliance as the NDA Election Manifesto before the last
general elections contained a pledge that a Commission would be
appointed to review the Constitution in the light of its working for fifty
years. The Pledge was affirmed in the President’s address to
Parliament and was followed by the appointment of this Commission
in February 2000.
